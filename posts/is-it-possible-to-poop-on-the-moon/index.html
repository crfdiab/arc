<h2 id=is-it-possible-to-poop-on-the-moon>Is it possible to poop on the Moon?</h2>
<p>With the Apollo 11 moon landing, astronauts took that microbial life to the most extreme environment it has ever been in. Which means the human feces on the moon — along with bags of urine, food waste, vomit, and other waste that also might contain microbial life — represents a natural, though unintended, experiment.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-astronauts-go-to-the-bathroom-on-the-moon>How did astronauts go to the bathroom on the Moon?</h2>
<p>Each fecal collection bag came with a “finger cot” to allow the astronauts to manually move things along. Then they had to knead a germicide into their waste so that gas-expelling bacteria wouldn’t flourish inside the sealed bag and cause it to explode. The first devices were just bags taped to astronauts’ butts.</p>
<h2 id=how-hard-is-it-to-poop-in-space>How hard is it to poop in space?</h2>
<p>To poop, astronauts used thigh straps to sit on the small toilet and to keep a tight seal between their bottoms and the toilet seat. It didn’t work very well and was hard to keep clean. So in 2018, NASA spent $23 million on a new and improved toilet for astronauts on the International Space Station.</p>
<h2 id=did-someone-pee-on-the-moon>Did someone pee on the Moon?</h2>
<p>Aldrin reentered Eagle first, but, before ascending the ladder, he was the first human to urinate on the Moon. With some difficulty they lifted film and two sample boxes containing 21.55 kilograms (47.5 lb) of lunar surface material to the hatch using a flat cable pulley device.</p>
<h2 id=is-it-true-that-astronauts-left-their-poop-on-the-moon>Is it true that astronauts left their poop on the Moon?</h2>
<p>Wait, astronauts pooped on the moon and just left it there?! After Neil Armstrong descended from the Eagle lander, becoming the first human to set foot on the moon, the very first picture he took on the surface shows, yes, the moon’s cratered surface, but also a white jettisoned trash bag (or jett bag).</p>
<h2 id=what-happens-if-you-pee-on-the-moon>What happens if you pee on the Moon?</h2>
<p>But it would land, not float away, because it has mass and the Moon does have gravity, albeit weaker than on Earth. So the urine will feel a downward force that will lead to it hitting the lunar surface eventually.</p>
<h2 id=why-did-they-leave-so-much-stuff-on-the-moon>Why did they leave so much stuff on the Moon?</h2>
<p>But pragmatism in part guided the decision to leave terrestrial material behind: The more stuff the astronauts discarded, the logic went, the more weight they freed up for bringing moon rocks back to Earth.</p>
<h2 id=is-it-ok-to-drain-energy-during-a-new-moon>Is it OK to drain energy during a new moon?</h2>
<p>This is a no no in general, but can’t always be avoided. However, new moon energy is incredibly special, so this is the one day a month that energy drains should be shunned. You want as much positive and creative energy as you can muster so that you set intentions that are vibrationally high. Energy drains contradict this.</p>
