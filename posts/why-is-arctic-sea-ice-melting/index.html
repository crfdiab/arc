<h2 id=why-is-arctic-sea-ice-melting>Why is Arctic sea ice melting?</h2>
<p>Human activities are at the root of this phenomenon. Specifically, since the industrial revolution, carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions have raised temperatures, even higher in the poles, and as a result, glaciers are rapidly melting, calving off into the sea and retreating on land.</p>
<h2 id=how-fast-is-arctic-sea-ice-melting>How fast is Arctic sea ice melting?</h2>
<p>Arctic sea ice reaches its minimum each September. September Arctic sea ice is now declining at a rate of 13.1 percent per decade, relative to the 1981 to 2010 average. This graph shows the average monthly Arctic sea ice extent each September since 1979, derived from satellite observations.</p>
<h2 id=what-would-happen-if-all-the-arctic-sea-ice-melted>What would happen if all the Arctic sea ice melted?</h2>
<p>If all the ice covering Antarctica , Greenland, and in mountain glaciers around the world were to melt, sea level would rise about 70 meters (230 feet). The ocean would cover all the coastal cities. And land area would shrink significantly. But many cities, such as Denver, would survive.</p>
<h2 id=which-is-the-best-aloe-vera-gel-in-the-world>Which is the best aloe vera gel in the world?</h2>
<p>With feedback from these and more dermatology pros, here are the best aloe vera gels.</p>
<ul>
<li>Best Overall: Sun Bum Cool Down Gel.</li>
<li>Best Budget: Fruit Of The Earth Aloe Vera Gel.</li>
<li>Best Organic: Seven Minerals Organic Aloe Vera Gel.</li>
<li>Best Natural: Bloomscape Hedgehog Aloe Plant.</li>
<li>Best for Acne: Badger Unscented Aloe Vera Gel.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id=how-does-the-melting-of-arctic-ice-affect-the-ocean>How does the melting of Arctic ice affect the ocean?</h2>
<p>The melting ice could, in turn, lead to changes in how nutrients and organic material in the ocean are mixed, significantly affecting the food chain and wildlife in the Arctic. The results reveal a delicate balance between wind and ocean as the sea ice pack recedes under climate change.</p>
<h2 id=what-makes-the-permafrost-melt-in-the-arctic>What makes the permafrost melt in the Arctic?</h2>
<p>“What seems to be a big determinant is the amount of sea ice in the Arctic, and when you make the Arctic free of sea ice it makes the permafrost much more likely to melt.” While the researchers are sure about the connection between the absence of sea ice and permafrost melting, they are less certain about how that connection works in practice.</p>
<h2 id=what-happens-to-the-sea-ice-when-it-freezes>What happens to the sea ice when it freezes?</h2>
<p>When ice freezes, the underlying water gets saltier and sinks, mixing the water column and bringing nutrients to the surface. The ice itself is habitat for animals such as seals, Arctic foxes, polar bears, and penguins. Life thrives along the margins of sea ice, as melting and freezing enhance circulation and bring nutrients to the surface.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-arctic-sea-ice-extent-in-september-2019>What was the Arctic sea ice extent in September 2019?</h2>
<p>Arctic sea ice extent for September 2019 was 4.32 million square kilometers (1.67 million square miles). The magenta line shows the 1981 to 2010 average extent for that month. Sea Ice Index data. About the data Credit: National Snow and Ice Data Center High-resolution image Figure 1b.</p>
