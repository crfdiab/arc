<h2 id=who-were-the-first-to-migrate-to-new-jersey>Who were the first to migrate to New Jersey?</h2>
<p>The first people to live on the land now known as New Jersey were the Delaware Indians. They lived here starting at least 10,000 years ago. Anywhere from 8,000 to 20,000 Delaware Indians lived in the area when the first Europeans arrived.</p>
<h2 id=what-did-new-jersey-do-first>What did New Jersey do first?</h2>
<p>On December 18, 1787, New Jersey became the third state to ratify the United States Constitution, and on November 20, 1789, New Jersey became the first state in the Nation to ratify the United States Bill of Rights. New Jersey played a major role in creating the structure of the new United States Government.</p>
<h2 id=how-was-new-jersey-divided>How was New Jersey divided?</h2>
<p>In 1676 the province was divided into East and West Jersey, the former going to Sir George Carteret and the latter to a group of Friends (Quakers). The division continued until 1702, when the entire province reverted to the crown.</p>
<h2 id=what-were-three-industries-that-started-in-new-jersey-in-colonial-times>What were three industries that started in New Jersey in colonial times?</h2>
<p>The New Jersey Colony exports agricultural products and natural resources including cattle, grain, rice, indigo (dye), wheat. Many flax and hemp farms are established in the Middle Colonies, furthering our textiles industry.</p>
<h2 id=how-long-did-it-take-to-travel-across-the-united-states-in-1800>How long did it take to travel across the United States in 1800?</h2>
<p>Look at this map below, taken from the Atlas of the Historical Geography of the United States published in 1932, which shows how long it would take someone in 1800 to travel across the country, using New York as a starting point: It seems unfathomable these days, but the above situation didn’t last for long.</p>
<h2 id=when-did-immigrants-first-come-to-new-jersey>When did immigrants first come to New Jersey?</h2>
<p>Nineteenth Century Immigration Beginning in the 1840s, immigration to New Jersey increased dramatically. About 80 percent of these new arrivals were from Germany and the British Isles. They supplied the needed manpower for the state’s growing industries.</p>
<h2 id=where-did-new-yorkers-go-on-vacation-in-1800>Where did New Yorkers go on vacation in 1800?</h2>
<p>It’s possible for a New Yorker to take a (very, very short) weekend trip to California, but in the year 1800, you would have needed to take the entire summer just to visit someone in Chicago. And if you made a friend on that vacation and then left, you probably wouldn’t ever see them again.</p>
<h2 id=who-was-the-first-european-to-explore-new-jersey>Who was the first European to explore New Jersey?</h2>
<p>Around 1524, Giovanni de Verrazano became the first European to explore New Jersey. He sailed along the coast and anchored off Sandy Hook. The colonial history of New Jersey started after Henry Hudson sailed through Newark Bay in 1609.</p>
