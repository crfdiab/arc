<h2 id=what-are-plastic-sandwich-bags-made-of>What are plastic sandwich bags made of?</h2>
<p>Ziploc bags (and other sandwich bags) are made with a product known as “film” in the recycling industry. Film is clear, thin plastic made of either low-density polyethylene (or LDPE, which corresponds to the recycling #4) or high-density polyethylene (or HDPE, which corresponds to the recycling #2).</p>
<h2 id=are-plastic-sandwich-bags-toxic>Are plastic sandwich bags toxic?</h2>
<p>Plastic sandwich and food storage bags are typically made from polyethylene, which is considered non-toxic.</p>
<h2 id=what-chemicals-are-in-plastic-grocery-bags>What chemicals are in plastic grocery bags?</h2>
<p>In the case of plastic bags, the repeating units are ethylene, or ethene. When ethylene molecules are polymerized to form polyethylene, they form long chains of carbon atoms in which each carbon also is bonded to two hydrogen atoms. Many kinds of polyethylene can be made from ethylene.</p>
<h2 id=are-sandwich-bags-pvc-free>Are sandwich bags PVC free?</h2>
<p>Ziplock bags DO NOT contain PVC. Just Carl actually contacted the manufacturer to confirm that there is no PVC in Ziploc brand products.</p>
<h2 id=do-you-throw-away-ziploc-bags>Do you throw away Ziploc bags?</h2>
<p>Yes, it’s true, Ziploc® brand bags are recyclable. Really! Just look for the bin next time you’re at your local participating store. Your used Ziploc® brand bags (clean and dry) go in the same bins as those plastic shopping bags.</p>
<h2 id=do-plastic-ziploc-bags-have-bpa>Do plastic Ziploc bags have BPA?</h2>
<p>SC Johnson’s Ziploc® brand Bags and Containers are BPA free. Our products are extensively evaluated for toxicity and safety and comply with applicable quality and safety regulations. Many reports of this study note that this chemical is commonly found in plastic food storage containers.</p>
<h2 id=do-plastic-food-bags-have-bpa>Do plastic food bags have BPA?</h2>
<p>BPA and phthalates are NOT found in plastic bags.</p>
<h2 id=why-did-grocery-stores-switch-to-plastic-bags>Why did grocery stores switch to plastic bags?</h2>
<p>Major grocery chains Safeway and Kroger replaced their paper bags with plastic ones. This saved the companies a significant amount of money because plastic bags were much less expensive than paper bags.</p>
<h2 id=can-you-microwave-a-sandwich-bag>Can you microwave a sandwich bag?</h2>
<p>Regular sandwich bags are not microwave safe. Unless the manufacturer clearly states that the sandwich bag is safe for microwave use, DO NOT use it in the microwave. Ziploc freezer bags are designed to defrost and reheat food, however caution should be exercised because the bag is not able to withstand high heat.</p>
<h2 id=why-are-stasher-bags-so-expensive>Why are Stasher bags so expensive?</h2>
<p>Stasher bags are made of all food-grade silicone, and are odorless. As a result of the higher quality product used for the bag, that also results in a higher priced bag (and according to online reviews on Amazon for similar products, they are also a lot higher quality when it comes to the zipper seal function as well).</p>
<h2 id=what-kind-of-plastic-is-in-grocery-bags>What kind of plastic is in grocery bags?</h2>
<p>The chemicals that make up plastic include BPA and DEHA. According to the Institute for Agriculture and Trade Policy, grocery bags are made from high density polyethylene or low density polyethylene and are usually coded for recycling as a 2 or 4.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-the-dangers-of-plastic-bags-for-food-storage>What are the dangers of plastic bags for food storage?</h2>
<p>According to the Texas Agricultural Extension Service, food in the pantry should be stored in airtight containers to prevent pests getting into them, including bugs and rodents. Plastic grocery bags are not airtight and should not be used. Food storage bags can be broken into or bit open by pests.</p>
<h2 id=are-there-any-food-containers-made-out-of-plastic>Are there any food containers made out of plastic?</h2>
<p>Many foods are sold in plastic containers and most of us keep leftovers in food storage containers made out of plastic, like Tupperware, Rubbermaid and other brands. While none of these containers seem to be made with phthalates, some may have BPA.</p>
<h2 id=what-can-you-put-in-a-sandwich-bag>What can you put in a sandwich bag?</h2>
<p>To avoid danger of suffocation, keep bags away from babies and young children. Not Recommended for use in microwave or for storage of liquids. Sandwich bags are ideal for packing sandwiches, pizza slices, subs, cookies, fruit, carrot sticks, chips and more.</p>
