<h2 id=why-did-the-english-go-to-new-england>Why did the English go to New England?</h2>
<p>The English Pilgrims were Puritans fleeing religious persecution in England who established the Plymouth Colony in 1620, the first English colony in New England and the second in America (The first European settlement in New England was a French colony established by Samuel de Champlain on Saint Croix Island, Maine in …</p>
<h2 id=how-did-the-first-colonists-arrive-in-new-england>How did the first colonists arrive in New England?</h2>
<p>Establishing the New England Colonies. A group of Puritans known as the Pilgrims arrived on the Mayflower from England and the Netherlands to establish Plymouth Colony in Massachusetts, the second successful English colony in North America following Jamestown, Virginia.</p>

<p>1600s<br>
In the 1600s, when the first English settlers began to arrive in New England, there were about 60,000 Native Americans living in what would later become the New England colonies (Plymouth, Massachusetts Bay, New Hampshire, Connecticut, New Haven, and Rhode Island).</p>
<h2 id=where-did-the-english-colonists-come-from>Where did the English colonists come from?</h2>
<p>Though a smaller proportion of the English population migrated to British North America after 1700, the colonies attracted new immigrants from other European countries, including Catholic settlers from Ireland and Protestant Germans. As the 18th century progressed, colonists began to settle far from the Atlantic coast.</p>
<h2 id=why-did-the-english-settlers-come-to-massachusetts>Why did the English settlers come to Massachusetts?</h2>
<p>The settlers in Massachusetts were seeking religious freedom. King Henry the Eighth of England had separated from the Roman Catholic Church. His daughter, Queen Elizabeth, established the Protestant faith in England. It was called the Church of England, or the Anglican Church.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-history-of-the-new-england-colonies>What was the history of the New England colonies?</h2>
<p>Centuries later, the New England colonies’ history shows the kind of duality that paints much of American history: The idea that native and immigrant cultures have come together to create the modern United States, coupled with the devastating conflicts and mistreatment that took place along the way.</p>
<h2 id=why-did-the-english-come-to-the-united-states>Why did the English come to the United States?</h2>
<p>The reasons for the English Immigration to America was at first based on obtaining profit from the new lands but quickly changed as people decided to move from England to escape religious and political prosecution. The prospect of a new life and owning some land was also a major reason for the English immigration to America.</p>
<h2 id=when-did-the-english-settlers-come-to-america>When did the English settlers come to America?</h2>
<p>It makes for a great story: when settlers moved from England to the Americas from the 17th Century, their speech patterns stuck in place. That was particularly true in more isolated parts of the US, such as on islands and in mountains.</p>
