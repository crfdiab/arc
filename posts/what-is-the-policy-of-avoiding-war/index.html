<h2 id=what-is-the-policy-of-avoiding-war>What is the policy of avoiding war?</h2>
<p>Appeasement is policy for avoiding war with an aggressive nation by giving in to its demands.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-the-policy-of-appeasement-lead-to-ww2>How did the policy of appeasement lead to WW2?</h2>
<p>How did appeasement lead to WW2? Spurred by voters who demanded “No more war”, the leaders of Britain, France, and the United states tried to avoid conflict through diplomacy. This resulted in weak western governments and this allowed Hitler and other countries to take advantage and cause war.</p>
<h2 id=who-started-isolationism>Who started isolationism?</h2>
<p>Isolationism has been a recurrent theme in U.S. history. It was given expression in the Farewell Address of Pres. George Washington and in the early 19th-century Monroe Doctrine. The term is most often applied to the political atmosphere in the U.S. in the 1930s.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-most-important-cause-of-ww2>What was the most important cause of ww2?</h2>
<p>The major causes of World War II were numerous. They include the impact of the Treaty of Versailles following WWI, the worldwide economic depression, failure of appeasement, the rise of militarism in Germany and Japan, and the failure of the League of Nations. Then, on September 1, 1939, German troops invaded Poland.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-us-foreign-policy-after-world-war-2>What was the US foreign policy after World War 2?</h2>
<p>If isolationism has become outdated, what kind of foreign policy does the United States follow? In the years after World War II, the United States was guided generally by containment — the policy of keeping communism from spreading beyond the countries already under its influence.</p>
<h2 id=why-was-the-league-of-nations-unable-to-prevent-world-war-2>Why was the League of Nations unable to prevent World War 2?</h2>
<p>Many historians and political theorists attribute the relative inability of the League of Nations to prevent World War II to U.S. isolationism and the country’s lack of participation and leadership in the organization.</p>
<h2 id=why-was-the-united-states-isolationist-after-world-war-1>Why was the United States isolationist after World War 1?</h2>
<p>S. government sought to enact greater limits on immigration after World War I because of strong anti-European sentiment, exacerbated by the “Red Scare” that convinced many Americans that communism, anarchism and a Bolshevik-style revolution would soon sweep the United States.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-the-cold-war-affect-third-world-countries>How did the Cold War affect third world countries?</h2>
<p>A good example of this was the armed intervention by the United States in the Dominican Republic in 1965, here the US aim was as suggested by Young & Kent, (2004) to stop the spread of communism in the region; in other words, this was a pre-emptive attack against communism.</p>
