<h2 id=what-does-a-rainforest-provide-to-our-earth>What does a rainforest provide to our earth?</h2>
<p>Rainforests are often called the lungs of the planet for their role in absorbing carbon dioxide, a greenhouse gas, and increasing local humidity. Rainforests also stabilize climate, house incredible amounts of plants and wildlife, and produce nourishing rainfall all around the planet.</p>
<h2 id=why-is-amazon-rain-forest-so-important-to-our-earth>Why is Amazon rain forest so important to our Earth?</h2>
<p>The Amazon rainforest plays an important part in regulating the world’s oxygen and carbon cycles. It produces roughly six percent of the world’s oxygen and has long been thought to act as a carbon sink, meaning it readily absorbs large amounts of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere.</p>
<h2 id=how-do-rain-forests-help-regulate-the-earths-climate>How do rain forests help regulate the Earth’s climate?</h2>
<p>Rainforests help stabilize the world’s climate by absorbing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. Scientists have shown that excess carbon dioxide in the atmosphere from human activities is contributing to climate change. Rainforests also affect local weather conditions by creating rainfall and moderating temperatures.</p>
<h2 id=how-much-oxygen-does-the-boreal-forest-produce>How much oxygen does the boreal forest produce?</h2>
<p>Like Earth’s other grand forests, the boreal plays a critical role in how the planet breathes through the process of photosynthesis. By extension, it also shapes the composition of the atmosphere, which today includes concentrations of oxygen, at about 21 per cent, and carbon dioxide, at roughly 0.04 per cent.</p>
<h2 id=how-can-a-rainforest-act-as-a-thermostat-for-the-whole-planet>How can a rainforest act as a thermostat for the whole planet?</h2>
<p>Rainforests produce about 20% of our oxygen and store a huge amount of carbon dioxide, drastically reducing the impact of greenhouse gas emissions. Massive amounts of solar radiation are absorbed, helping regulate temperatures around the globe. Taken together, these processes help to stabilize Earth’s climate.</p>
<h2 id=why-are-forests-important-to-climate>Why are forests important to climate?</h2>
<p>Forests are a stabilising force for the climate. They regulate ecosystems, protect biodiversity, play an integral part in the carbon cycle, support livelihoods, and supply goods and services that can drive sustainable growth. Increasing and maintaining forests is therefore an essential solution to climate change.</p>
<h2 id=how-does-the-rain-forest-help-the-world>How does the rain forest help the world?</h2>
<p>(4) Rainforests help to produce mass amounts of rain every year. The water from this rainfall cycles throughout the entire planet and prevents droughts. As the rainforest gets smaller, this water cycle is also affected, leading to less and less water in certain parts of the world.</p>
<h2 id=how-much-oxygen-does-the-amazon-rainforest-produce>How much oxygen does the Amazon rainforest produce?</h2>
<p>The Amazon rainforest alone produces nearly 20 percent of the world’s oxygen. However, the term “oxygen production” is quite misleading, as the decomposition of organic plant and animal matter in rainforests actually consumes about the same amount of oxygen as the forests produce.</p>
<h2 id=how-much-rain-does-a-tropical-rainforest-get>How much rain does a tropical rainforest get?</h2>
<p>Forests close to the Equator, as in Malaysia, receive year round rain are known as evergreen equatorial rainforests. Rain in these areas falls at a rate of between 100 and 400 inches a year; there is no winter, days and nights are equal in length and a consistently high temperature of around 21 – 32 degrees is maintained.</p>
<h2 id=what-kind-of-products-come-from-rain-forests>What kind of products come from rain forests?</h2>
<p>Common products we use that have originated from the tropics and rain forests include, of course, coconuts, rubber and palm oil, Malaysia’s popular agricultural crops, as well as common staples such as coffee, cane sugar and cocoa.</p>
