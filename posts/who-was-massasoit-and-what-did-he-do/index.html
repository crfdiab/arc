<h2 id=who-was-massasoit-and-what-did-he-do>Who was Massasoit and what did he do?</h2>
<p>Massasoit (died 1661) was a principal leader of the Wampanoag people in the early 1600s who encouraged friendship with English settlers. As leader of the Wampanoag, Massasoit exercised control over a number of Indian groups that occupied lands from Narragansett Bay to Cape Cod in present-day Massachusetts.</p>
<h2 id=what-did-massasoit-help-them-arrange>What did Massasoit help them arrange?</h2>
<p>Squanto helped arrange a peace treaty, or agreement, between Massasoit and the Pilgrims. The Wampanoags and the Pilgrims promised not to fight each other. They also agreed to help protect each other against attacks by other American Indians.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-massasoit-famous-for>What is Massasoit famous for?</h2>
<p>Massasoit, (born c. 1590, near present Bristol, Rhode Island, U.S.—died 1661, near Bristol), Wampanoag Indian chief who throughout his life maintained peaceful relations with English settlers in the area of the Plymouth Colony, Massachusetts.</p>
<h2 id=when-did-winslow-come-to-the-side-of-chief-massasoit>When did Winslow come to the side of Chief Massasoit?</h2>
<p>For example, in one story when Massasoit contracted an illness in March 1623, Plymouth colonist Winslow is reported to have come to the side of the dying sachem, feeding him “comfortable conserves” and sassafras tea.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-winslow-give-massasoit-his-eye-sight>How did Winslow give Massasoit his eye sight?</h2>
<p>Winslow gave him a little bit of medicine, and scraped out the inside of his mouth which had swollen up preventing him from eating or drinking anything. Then he gave Massasoit some water and more medicine. In about half an hour, Massasoit had regained his eye sight and was getting better.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-relationship-between-the-pilgrims-and-massasoit>What was the relationship between the pilgrims and Massasoit?</h2>
<p>Massasoit and the Pilgrims. Some months after the Pilgrims arrived in Plymouth in 1620, the Indian leader appeared in the new colony and offered friendship. After some negotiations, the chief signed a peace treaty with the English, one vowing nonaggression and mutual defense in case either were attacked.</p>
<h2 id=who-was-the-colonial-leader-of-massasoit-in-1621>Who was the colonial leader of Massasoit in 1621?</h2>
<p>Massasoit forged critical ties with colonial leaders William Bradford, Edward Winslow, Stephen Hopkins, John Carver, and Myles Standish. These ties grew out of a peace treaty finalized on March 22, 1621.</p>
