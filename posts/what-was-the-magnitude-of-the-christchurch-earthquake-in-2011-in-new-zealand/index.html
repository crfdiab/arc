<h2 id=what-was-the-magnitude-of-the-christchurch-earthquake-in-2011-in-new-zealand>What was the magnitude of the Christchurch earthquake in 2011 in New Zealand?</h2>
<p>magnitude 6.3<br>
On Tuesday 22 February 2011 at 12.51 p.m. Christchurch was badly damaged by a magnitude 6.3 earthquake, which killed 185 people and injured several thousand. The earthquake epicentre was near Lyttelton, just 10 kilometres south-east of Christchurch’s central business district.</p>
<h2 id=what-magnitude-was-the-first-christchurch-earthquake>What magnitude was the first Christchurch earthquake?</h2>
<p>On 13 June 2011 a magnitude 6.3 earthquake struck Christchurch at a depth of 6 kilometres (3.7 mi). It was preceded by a magnitude 5.6 tremor, and affected many structures previously damaged by other earthquakes. The earthquake injured a total of 46 people, while many others were evacuated from the city centre.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-damage-of-the-christchurch-earthquake-2011>What was the damage of the Christchurch Earthquake 2011?</h2>
<p>Earthquake damage Many stone and brick buildings in Christchurch were damaged. Up to 100,000 buildings were damaged and about 10,000 buildings needed to be demolished. Christchurch was divided into four zones after the earthquake. The land in the Green Zone was undamaged and could be built on again.</p>

2011 Christchurch earthquake/Start dates</p>
<h2 id=how-did-the-christchurch-earthquake-affect-the-economy>How did the Christchurch earthquake affect the economy?</h2>
<p>Impacts on the built and economic environment. The September 2010 earthquake caused an estimated repair and rebuilding cost of about NZ$5 billion, and the financial markets were largely unaffected [41]. The cost of repairing damage caused by the aftershock sequence is significantly higher.</p>
<h2 id=why-didnt-a-tsunami-occur-in-the-christchurch-earthquake-2011>Why didn’t a tsunami occur in the Christchurch earthquake 2011?</h2>
<p>The September 2010, February 2011 and June 2011 earthquakes did not cause tsunamis because they happened on land and did not disrupt the sea floor. The movement was not big enough to break the sea floor and create a tsunami. The aftershocks from these earthquakes were also too small to cause a tsunami.</p>
<h2 id=how-many-deaths-were-there-in-the-christchurch-earthquake-2011>How many deaths were there in the Christchurch earthquake 2011?</h2>
<p>185 people<br>
It caused widespread damage across Christchurch, killing 185 people, in the nation’s fifth-deadliest disaster.</p>
<h2 id=what-were-the-social-impacts-of-the-christchurch-earthquake>What were the social impacts of the Christchurch earthquake?</h2>
<p>Social and economic 181 people were killed. Damaged sewage pipes contaminated water supplies which increased risk of disease. Businesses were closed for a long time. Christchurch could not host five Rugby World Cup matches.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-liquefaction-effect-christchurch>How did liquefaction effect Christchurch?</h2>
<p>Liquefaction caused widespread damage during the Christchurch earthquake of 22 February 2011. In the central city, silt was pushed up and partly buried parked cars. Severe shaking in an earthquake puts pressure on the silt and water particles in these waterlogged layers, turning once firm sediment into a liquid.</p>
<h2 id=how-long-did-the-christchurch-earthquake-last-2011>How long did the Christchurch earthquake last 2011?</h2>
<p>two months<br>
While the initial quake only lasted for approximately 10 seconds, the damage was severe because of the location and shallowness of the earthquake’s focus in relation to Christchurch as well as previous quake damage…</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-cause-of-the-christchurch-earthquake-in-2011>What was the cause of the Christchurch earthquake in 2011?</h2>
<p>The hidden fault that caused the February 2011 Christchurch earthquake. In September 2010, Christchurch was shaken by the magnitude 7.1 Darfield earthquake, caused by movement along faults west of the city on the Canterbury Plains. Considering this, what type of plate boundary caused the Christchurch Earthquake 2011?</p>
<h2 id=when-was-the-last-earthquake-in-new-zealand>When was the last earthquake in New Zealand?</h2>
<p>The USGS characterized the 6.3-magnitude quake on February 22 as an aftershock of the quake that struck to the west, in Darfield, New Zealand, on September 3, 2010. Darfield lies about 50 kilometers (30 miles) west-northwest of Christchurch.</p>
<h2 id=how-many-people-were-killed-in-the-canterbury-earthquake>How many people were killed in the Canterbury earthquake?</h2>
<p>One of the worst incidents was the collapse of the Canterbury Television (CTV) building, in the city centre, which was razed almost entirely. An estimated 100 or more people had been in the building at the time of the quake.</p>
<h2 id=who-was-involved-in-the-new-zealand-earthquake>Who was involved in the New Zealand earthquake?</h2>
<p>More than 1,000 New Zealand Defence Force personnel led the response, aided by more than 100 members of the Singaporean armed forces who were in New Zealand for a joint training exercise at the time of the quake. Australia, Japan, Singapore, the United Kingdom, the United States, and other countries also sent hundreds of search-and-rescue workers.</p>
