<h2 id=how-many-locks-are-in-the-panama-canal>How many locks are in the Panama canal?</h2>
<p>twelve locks<br>
There are twelve locks in total. A two-step flight at Miraflores, and a single flight at Pedro Miguel, lift ships from the Pacific up to Gatun Lake; then a triple flight at Gatun lowers them to the Atlantic side.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-difference-between-the-panama-canal-and-the-suez-canal>What is the difference between the Panama canal and the Suez Canal?</h2>
<p>The Suez Canal is in Egypt, and it connects the Mediterranean Sea and Red Sea. This allows water transportation between Europe and Asia, so they do not have to go through a long route which takes more time. The Panama Canal was created in 1914 and is 77 km long connecting two oceans – the Atlantic and the Pacific.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-so-special-about-the-panama-canal>What is so special about the Panama canal?</h2>
<p>The canal permits shippers of commercial goods, ranging from automobiles to grain, to save time and money by transporting cargo more quickly between the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans. After the canal was completed, approximately 8,000 miles were eliminated from the trip.</p>
<h2 id=how-do-the-locks-work-in-the-panama-canal>How do the locks work in the Panama canal?</h2>
<p>The canal has a water lock system that acts like a massive elevator. When ships enter the locks, they’re raised by water from the lake. Each lock raises the ships until they’re 85 feet above sea level. They then travel across Gatun Lake.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-difference-between-the-panama-canal-and-ballard-locks>What was the difference between the Panama Canal and Ballard Locks?</h2>
<p>The difference between the tropical location of the Panama Canal and the much more temperate location of the Ballard Locks made a world of difference between what was–in the sense of engineering goals–two very similar projects The Panama Canal changed world shipping forever.</p>
<h2 id=how-is-the-panama-canal-different-from-the-atlantic-ocean>How is the Panama Canal different from the Atlantic Ocean?</h2>
<p>Not commonly known is the fact that the two oceans have different sea levels, and different levels of high tide. At the entrance to the Panama Canal, the Pacific Ocean can rise as much as 20 feet, but 45 miles away, the difference between high tide and low in the Atlantic is just three feet.</p>
<h2 id=is-there-a-panama-canal-without-the-chagres>Is there a Panama Canal without the Chagres?</h2>
<p>Without the Chagres and the immense amount of water that flows from it, there could be no Panama Canal. The three steps of the Gatun Locks each lower ships about 28 feet, to the level of the Atlantic Ocean.</p>
<h2 id=how-long-does-it-take-to-pass-through-the-panama-canal>How long does it take to pass through the Panama Canal?</h2>
<p>The Panama Canal (Spanish: Canal de Panamá) is an artificial 82 km (51 mi) waterway in Panama that connects the Atlantic Ocean with the Pacific Ocean. The canal cuts across the Isthmus of Panama and is a conduit for maritime trade. It takes 11.38 hours to pass through the Panama Canal.</p>
