<h2 id=what-disease-causes-fingers-and-toes-to-turn-black>What disease causes fingers and toes to turn black?</h2>
<p>Buerger’s Disease Complications Over time, Buerger’s disease can slow — and completely stop — the blood flow to your fingers and toes. This can cause gangrene, which means the skin and tissue in your toes and fingers start to die. They go numb and turn blue or black.</p>
<h2 id=which-of-the-following-diseases-may-cause-fingers-and-toes-to-turn-white>Which of the following diseases may cause fingers and toes to turn white?</h2>
<p>Raynaud’s disease causes smaller arteries that supply blood flow to the skin to narrow in response to cold or stress. The affected body parts, usually fingers and toes, might turn white or blue and feel cold and numb until circulation improves, usually when you get warm.</p>
<h2 id=is-raynauds-disease-serious>Is Raynaud’s disease serious?</h2>
<p>When blood flow returns, the skin turns red, and may throb or tingle. In very rare, severe cases, the loss of blood flow can cause ulcers or tissue death, but usually, Raynaud’s is not dangerous—it’s just painful and frustrating.</p>
<h2 id=what-causes-fingers-to-get-cold-and-turn-white>What causes fingers to get cold and turn white?</h2>
<p>Raynaud’s disease is a rare disorder of the blood vessels, usually in the fingers and toes. It causes the blood vessels to narrow when you are cold or feeling stressed. When this happens, blood can’t get to the surface of the skin and the affected areas turn white and blue.</p>
<h2 id=can-raynauds-go-away>Can Raynaud’s go away?</h2>
<p>Symptoms of Raynaud’s can last from a few minutes to several hours. It’s not a serious threat to your health, but can be annoying to live with, because it can be difficult to use your fingers. People with Raynaud’s often go for long periods without any symptoms, and sometimes the condition goes away altogether.</p>
<h2 id=what-causes-black-hands-and-feet>What causes black hands and feet?</h2>
<p>Raynaud disease is a disorder that affects blood circulation, usually in the hands and feet. The arteries (blood vessels) that carry blood to your fingers, toes, ears, or nose tighten. This is often triggered by cold or emotional stress. The decrease in blood flow causes a lack of oxygen and changes in skin color.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-blood-test-for-raynauds-syndrome>What is the blood test for Raynaud’s Syndrome?</h2>
<p>Your doctor may order blood tests to look for conditions that are linked to secondary Raynaud’s. Examples include antinuclear antibody (ANA), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR or “sed rate”), and C-reactive protein (CRP) blood tests.</p>
<h2 id=what-foods-to-avoid-if-you-have-raynauds>What foods to avoid if you have Raynaud’s?</h2>
<p>Always try to maintain a balanced, healthy diet and avoid caffeine and alcohol. Some food supplements have helped Raynaud’s sufferers, including evening primrose oil, gingko biloba and fish oils. Certain foods are also believed to help, like ginger, garlic and spicy food.</p>
<h2 id=why-do-i-suddenly-have-raynauds>Why do I suddenly have Raynaud’s?</h2>
<p>Why does it happen? Raynaud’s is usually triggered by cold temperatures, anxiety or stress. The condition occurs because your blood vessels go into a temporary spasm, which blocks the flow of blood. This causes the affected area to change colour to white, then blue and then red, as the bloodflow returns.</p>
<h2 id=what-vitamins-are-good-for-raynauds>What vitamins are good for Raynaud’s?</h2>
<p>These supplements may help:</p>
<ul>
<li>Omega-3 fatty acids , found in fish oil, may reduce symptoms in people with primary Raynaud’s, according to one study.</li>
<li>Evening primrose oil (EPO) .</li>
<li>Inositol hexaniacinate , a form of vitamin B3 or niacin, may reduce frequency of Raynaud’s attacks.</li>
<li>Magnesium opens up blood vessels.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id=how-can-i-get-rid-of-black-hands-and-feet>How can I get rid of black hands and feet?</h2>
<p>Here are a few natural remedies that you must try to get rid of dark hands and feet.</p>
<ol>
<li>1 . Raw Milk. It is one of the oldest and most effective natural remedies for dark hands.</li>
<li>2 . Cucumber. Cucumber forms an important ingredient in a lot of natural facial packs.</li>
<li>3 . Orange Peel.</li>
<li>4 . Potato.</li>
<li>5 . Gram Flour (Besan)</li>
<li>6 . Tomato.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id=why-do-my-feet-go-purple>Why do my feet go purple?</h2>
<p>Peripheral artery disease, a condition characterized by poor blood flow to the lower extremities, can cause the feet to gradually turn purple or blue. Diabetes can have a similar effect on the feet. If you notice a discoloration in the skin of your feet, please see that you seek the care of a podiatrist.</p>
<h2 id=how-many-fingers-and-toes-have-been-lost-in-the-polar-vortex>How many fingers and toes have been lost in the polar vortex?</h2>
<p>This almost always results in permanent tissue damage and may result in amputation of fingers, toes, even feet, hands and parts of the arm or leg. Many polar explorers and mountaineers have lost parts of some fingers or toes because of frostbite.</p>
<h2 id=what-causes-frostbite-on-the-fingers-and-toes>What causes frostbite on the fingers and toes?</h2>
<p>Frostbite is caused by exposure to very cold temperatures or water, or very long exposure to less cold temperatures. Frostbite usually affects fingers, toes, faces, and ears.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-humans-deal-with-the-cold-in-antarctica>How did humans deal with the cold in Antarctica?</h2>
<p>In Antarctica, I was most aware of this when axing through sea-ice to make a hole for a diver (to set fishing nets).</p>
<h2 id=why-do-my-fingernails-turn-blue-in-the-cold>Why do my fingernails turn blue in the Cold?</h2>
<p>Blue fingernails may be your body’s reaction to cold temperatures or it could be the result of cyanosis, a condition in which red blood cells lack oxygen and turn a person’s fingernails blue, according to Healthline. If this seems to be the case, a trip to the doctor to measure your blood’s oxygenation levels may be in order.</p>
