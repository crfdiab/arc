<h2 id=where-did-benjamin-franklin-and-deborah-read-live>Where did Benjamin Franklin and Deborah Read live?</h2>
<p>Deborah simply moved into Franklin’s home and printing house at what is now 139 Market Street. Soon she took in the infant son her new husband had fathered with another woman and began running a small stationery store on the first floor.</p>
<h2 id=where-did-benjamin-franklin-family-come-from>Where did Benjamin Franklin family come from?</h2>
<p>Benjamin Franklin was born on January 17, 1706, in colonial Boston. His father, Josiah Franklin (1657-1745), a native of England, was a candle and soap maker who married twice and had 17 children. Franklin’s mother was Abiah Folger (1667-1752) of Nantucket, Massachusetts, Josiah’s second wife.</p>

<p>Deborah Read Franklin. Birth: 1708 Marlborough, Middlesex County, Massachusetts, USA. Death: Dec. 19, 1774 Philadelphia, Philadelphia County, Pennsylvania, USA. Wife of Statesman, Benjamin Franklin,</p>

<p>Deborah Read was born about 1707 to John Read, a carpenter from London, England, and Sarah White Read of Birmingham, England. Whether the child was born while her parents still lived in Birmingham, or after they moved to Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, remains uncertain.</p>
<h2 id=how-many-children-did-franklin-and-deborah-read-have>How many children did Franklin and Deborah Read have?</h2>
<p>They had two children together: Francis Folger “Franky” (born 1732), who died of smallpox in 1736 at the age of four, and Sarah “Sally” (born 1743). Read also helped to raise Franklin’s illegitimate son William, whose mother’s identity is still unknown.</p>
<h2 id=when-did-franklin-and-deborah-read-return-to-philadelphia>When did Franklin and Deborah Read return to Philadelphia?</h2>
<p>While Franklin stayed overseas for the next five years, Read remained in Philadelphia where, despite her limited education, she successfully ran her husband’s businesses, maintained their home, cared for the couple’s children and regularly attended Quaker Meeting. Franklin returned to Philadelphia in November 1762.</p>
