<h2 id=what-did-chico-mendes-do>What did Chico Mendes do?</h2>
<p>Brazilian rubber tapper and land rights leader Chico Mendes pioneered the world’s first tropical forest conservation initiative advanced by forest peoples themselves. His work led to the establishment of Brazil’s extractive reserves protected forest areas that are inhabited and managed by local communities.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-chico-mendes-family-business>What was Chico Mendes family business?</h2>
<p>The Mendes family lived in the state of Acre in Amazonia, the forest surrounding the Amazon River. They earned their living as rubber tappers, workers who extract latex from rubber trees and cure the substance for sale in the production of rubber.</p>

<h2 id=did-chico-mendes-go-to-college>Did Chico Mendes go to college?</h2>
<p>Mendes received no formal education. As a boy, he worked in rubber tapping alongside his father, just before prices for natural rubber declined and working conditions for the seringueiros worsened.</p>

Chico Mendes/Assassinated</p>
<h2 id=at-what-age-did-chico-mendes-learn-to-read>At what age did Chico Mendes learn to read?</h2>
<p>18 years old<br>
For this reason, Mendes did not learn to read until he was 18 years old, when he sought out help interpreting his bills. Mendes was taught to read and write by a man named Euclides Fernando Távora, an activist turned rubber tapper.</p>

<h2 id=who-is-cutting-down-the-trees-in-the-amazon-rainforest>Who is cutting down the trees in the Amazon rainforest?</h2>
<p>Cattle ranching is the leading cause of deforestation in the Amazon rainforest. In Brazil, this has been the case since at least the 1970s: government figures attributed 38 percent of deforestation from 1966-1975 to large-scale cattle ranching. Today the figure in Brazil is closer to 70 percent.</p>
<h2 id=who-was-chico-mendes-and-what-did-he-do>Who was Chico Mendes and what did he do?</h2>
<p>Chico Mendes, original name Francisco Alves Mendes, Jr., (born December 15, 1944, Xapuri, Acre, Brazil—died December 22, 1988, Xapuri), Brazilian labour leader and conservationist who defended the interests of the seringueiros, or rubber tree tappers, in the Amazonian state of Acre, calling for land reform and preservation of the Amazon Rainforest.</p>
<h2 id=where-was-the-rubber-tapper-chico-mendes-born>Where was the rubber tapper Chico Mendes born?</h2>
<p>Francisco “Chico” Alves Mendes Filho was born on December 15, 1944, in a rubber reserve called Seringal Bom Futuro, outside of Xapuri, a small town in the state of Acre. He was the son of a second-generation rubber tapper, Francisco Mendes, and his wife, Iracê.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-chico-mendes-help-the-seringueiros>How did Chico Mendes help the seringueiros?</h2>
<p>In 1985 Mendes and other leaders founded the National Council of Rubber Tappers in Brasília, and Mendes soon became the spokesperson for seringueiros throughout the country. He emphasized the need to establish forest reserves from which a variety of products could be sustainably extracted to benefit peasant and indigenous communities.</p>
<h2 id=why-did-chico-mendes-want-to-save-the-amazon-rainforest>Why did Chico Mendes want to save the Amazon rainforest?</h2>
<p>At first I thought I was fighting to save rubber trees, then I thought I was fighting to save the Amazon rainforest. Now I realize I am fighting for humanity. To save the rainforest, Chico Mendes and the rubber workers union asked the government to set up reserves as they wanted people to use the forest without damaging it.</p>
