<h2 id=what-two-hemispheres-are-we-located-in>What two hemispheres are we located in?</h2>
<p>North, South, East, and West Any given location in the world is in two hemispheres at once: Northern or Southern and Eastern or Western. The United States, for example, is in both the Northern and Western hemispheres and Australia is in the Southern and Eastern hemispheres.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-eastern-hemisphere-and-western-hemisphere>What is Eastern Hemisphere and Western Hemisphere?</h2>
<p>The Western Hemisphere is a geographical term for the half of Earth which lies west of the prime meridian (which crosses Greenwich, London, United Kingdom) and east of the antimeridian. The other half is called the Eastern Hemisphere.</p>
<h2 id=does-africa-cover-4-hemispheres>Does Africa cover 4 hemispheres?</h2>
<p>The continent of Africa has regions that lie within all four hemispheres. The majority of Africa is found in the Eastern Hemisphere, while about two-thirds are located in the Northern Hemisphere. One-third lies in the Southern Hemisphere and a small portion is located in the Western Hemisphere.</p>
<h2 id=where-are-the-northern-and-southern-hemispheres-located>Where are the northern and southern hemispheres located?</h2>
<p>The Equator, or line of 0 degrees latitude, divides the Earth into the Northern and Southern hemispheres. The Northern Hemisphere contains North America, the northern part of South America, Europe, the northern two-thirds of Africa, and most of Asia.</p>
<h2 id=which-is-the-east-and-west-hemisphere-of-the-earth>Which is the east and West hemisphere of the Earth?</h2>
<p>The most common such divisions are by latitudinal or longitudinal markers : Eastern Hemisphere, the half that lies east of the prime meridian and west of the 180th meridian Western Hemisphere, the half that lies west of the prime meridian and east of the 180th meridian</p>
<h2 id=how-many-hemispheres-are-there-in-the-world>How many hemispheres are there in the world?</h2>
<p>Four different hemispheres are generally considered by geographers. These are the Northern, Southern, Eastern, and Western hemispheres. The Equator is the 0° latitude line at the Earth’s center, which divides the Earth into the Northern and Southern hemispheres.</p>
<h2 id=is-the-celestial-pole-in-the-northern-or-southern-hemisphere>Is the celestial pole in the northern or Southern Hemisphere?</h2>
<p>The celestial pole is north in the northern hemisphere, south in the south hemisphere. When a gnomon points to the equator, that means north in the southern hemisphere, and south in the northern hemisphere.</p>
