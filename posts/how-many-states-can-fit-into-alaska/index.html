<h2 id=is-alaska-bigger-than-any-country>Is Alaska bigger than any country?</h2>
<p>Alaska is bigger than many countries. If Alaska were a country, it would rank 33rd out of 239 countries in the world. It is twice the size of the country Sweden. Alaska is one-fifth the size of all the Lower 48 states in the U.S.</p>
<h2 id=is-alaska-really-that-big>Is Alaska really that big?</h2>

<h2 id=are-there-any-states-that-can-fit-inside-alaska>Are there any states that can fit inside Alaska?</h2>
