<p>The Pyrenees (les Pyrénées), stretch from the Atlantic to the Mediterranean coasts in the south of France, marking the border between France and Spain, with the tiny country of Andorra nestled in the mountains. The mountain range is 270 miles (430 km) long with its widest point at 80 miles (129 km).</p>

<p>Barre des Ecrins is the only mountain in France that lies outside the Mont Blanc Massif. It was also considered the highest mountain in France before the annexation of Savoy in 1960. The first ascent to the summit was on 25 June 1864. The Grande Casse is the highest mountain of the Vanoise Massif in the Graian Alps in the region of Savoie, France.</p>
