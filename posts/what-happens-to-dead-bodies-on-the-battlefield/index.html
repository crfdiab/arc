<h2 id=what-happens-to-dead-bodies-on-the-battlefield>What happens to dead bodies on the battlefield?</h2>
<p>Typically in modern times the bodies are buried by the local people or military units after identification as much as possible. Most modern western armies return the bodies for burial in their home nation, other armies they are often buried in cemeteries within the the battlezone.</p>
<h2 id=what-happened-to-dead-soldiers-after-battle>What happened to dead soldiers after battle?</h2>
<p>If this wasn’t possible, the bodies of soldiers killed in battle would be collected and given a mass cremation or burial. In the event the bodies couldn’t be recovered, a cenotaph would be erected to serve as a monument to the individual.</p>

<p>After the fight was over, the dead were usually exhumed and interred to either a large common cemetery or transported back home (the Americans always took home all their fallen). There are many huge war cemeteries everywhere in Europe, both in the East and the West.</p>
<h2 id=what-did-they-do-with-the-dead-at-the-battle-of-waterloo>What did they do with the dead at the Battle of Waterloo?</h2>
<p>The slow, gory task of disposing of thousands of dead bodies fell to surviving soldiers and local peasants, who dragged and dumped them into huge pits. Dead, horses had their metal shoes ripped off for re-selling before being arranged in vast pyres and set alight.</p>
<h2 id=how-many-british-soldiers-died-in-the-battle-of-waterloo>How many British soldiers died in the Battle of Waterloo?</h2>
<p>Gareth Glover, a military historian has discovered a book which he believes contains an eyewitness account of a mass grave that was used to inter 7,000 British and allied corpses. Over the course of the Battle of Waterloo in 1815, there were French losses of around 24,000 and approximately 17,000 casualties on the allied side.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-napoleon-lose-the-battle-of-waterloo>How did Napoleon lose the Battle of Waterloo?</h2>
<p>Despite his long-standing genius in the campaign, Napoleon was unable to defeat the Allied armies, and the Prussians finished determining his fate by coming to the aid of Wellington on June 18, rather than backing off after his setback at Ligny. Who defeated Napoleon at the Battle of Waterloo?</p>
<h2 id=how-many-amputations-were-there-during-the-battle-of-waterloo>How many amputations were there during the Battle of Waterloo?</h2>
<p>Retired surgeon and expert in Napoleonic medicine, Michael Crumplin, has shown that, among the wounded, there were more than 2,000 amputations. The procedure at that time took 15 minutes, using knives and saws, and with no meaningful anaesthetic. Perhaps the most famous amputee of the battle was Lord Uxbridge, Wellington’s cavalry commander.</p>
