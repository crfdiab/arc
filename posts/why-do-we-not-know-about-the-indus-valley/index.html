<h2 id=why-do-we-not-know-about-the-indus-valley>Why do we not know about the Indus Valley?</h2>
<p>It began nearly 5,000 years ago in an area of modern-day Pakistan and Northern India. There were more than 1,400 towns and cities in the Indus Valley. We do not know what the Indus people called their cities, because nobody has been able to translate their ancient language.</p>
<h2 id=what-do-we-not-know-about-indus-valley-civilization>What do we not know about Indus Valley Civilization?</h2>
<p>Unlike Mesopotamia and Ancient Egypt, the inhabitants of the Indus Valley Civilization did not build large, monumental structures. There is no conclusive evidence of palaces or temples—or even of kings, armies, or priests—and the largest structures may be granaries.</p>
<h2 id=what-do-we-know-about-the-indus-valley-civilization>What do we know about the Indus Valley civilization?</h2>
<p>Indus civilization, also called Indus valley civilization or Harappan civilization, the earliest known urban culture of the Indian subcontinent. The nuclear dates of the civilization appear to be about 2500–1700 bce, though the southern sites may have lasted later into the 2nd millennium bce.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-two-reasons-we-know-very-little-about-the-indus-valley-civilization>What are two reasons we know very little about the Indus Valley civilization?</h2>
<p>What are two reasons we know very little about the Indus Valley Civilization? We cannot decipher their script or written language. Much of their civilization is buried under a water table.</p>
<h2 id=how-mohenjo-daro-came-to-an-end>How Mohenjo-Daro came to an end?</h2>
<p>Apparently the Indus civillization was likely destroyed by the Indo-European migrants from Iran, the Aryans. The cities of Mohenjo-Daro and Harappa were built of fire-baked bricks. Over the centuries the need for wood for brick-making denuded the country side and this may have contributed to the downfall.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-the-indus-make-a-living>How did the Indus make a living?</h2>
<p>Farmers grew wheat, barley, cotton, and rice on land fertilized by yearly Indus River floods. They also raised animals. In towns, people made cloth, pottery, metalwork, and jewelry. On the coast, they went abroad to trade.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-life-like-in-the-indus-valley>What was life like in the Indus Valley?</h2>
<p>It was very hot in the Indus Valley so people spent a lot of time outside. Most people had small homes which were also used as workshops. There was not much space to relax. Richer families had courtyards.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-some-important-facts-about-the-indus-valley-civilization>What are some important facts about the Indus Valley Civilization?</h2>
<p>Some important ancient Indian history topics that will complement your reading on IVC are linked below: The Mesopotamia, Egypt, China and the Indus Valley Civilization, are considered to be the four great civilisations of the ancient world, the first three (Mesopotamia, Egypt, and China) have been broadly studied and well-known to everyone.</p>
<h2 id=how-many-symbols-are-there-in-the-indus-valley>How many symbols are there in the Indus Valley?</h2>
<p>36. The Indus Valley Script has not been deciphered yet At least 400 different symbols have been identified inscribed in various objects. These symbols usually appear in strings of 3-20. Despite best attempts by scholars have not been able to translate or even interpret them in any way.</p>
<h2 id=which-is-the-fourth-civilization-in-the-world>Which is the fourth civilization in the world?</h2>
<p>The fourth civilization, the Indus Valley Civilisation, which prospers along the flood plains of the Rivers Indus and Gaggar-Hakra, is lost in human memory. Today, relative to other cultures, we know little about this technologically advanced society. Check out these less well-known Indus Valley Civilization Facts that just deserve to be shared.</p>
<h2 id=what-kind-of-crafts-did-the-indus-valley-people-use>What kind of crafts did the Indus Valley people use?</h2>
<p>Those people had mastered many crafts including shell working, ceramics, agate and satellite bead making. They were also obsessed with ornaments like necklaces and bangles, which is evident in almost all phases of Harappan culture. Some of these crafts are still practiced in the subcontinent today.</p>
