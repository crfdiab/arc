<p>New England’s economy depended on the environment. Its location near the Atlantic Ocean along a jagged coastline determined how people made a living. People in New England made money through fishing, whaling, shipbuilding, trading in its port cities and providing naval supplies.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-life-like-in-new-england>What was life like in New England?</h2>
<p>The New England colonies had very harsh winters and mild summers. This made the growing season only about five months long. Because the soil was rocky and the climate was often harsh, colonists in New England only farmed enough to feed their families. Some of these crops included corn, beans, and squash.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-the-cities-in-the-new-england-colonies>What are the cities in the New England colonies?</h2>
<ul>
<li>Major cities of New England.</li>

<li>Providence, Rhode Island.</li>
<li>Springfield, Massachusetts.</li>
<li>Bridgeport, Connecticut.</li>
<li>New Haven, Connecticut.</li>

<h2 id=what-did-the-colonists-do-for-christmas-in-new-england>What did the colonists do for Christmas in New England?</h2>
<p>Colonists Imported English Traditions Despite Puritan efforts, many colonists in New England did celebrate Christmas, importing English customs such as drinking, feasting, mumming and wassailing. Mumming, or “masking,” involved people dressing up in costume and going from house to house, putting on plays and otherwise performing.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-name-of-the-new-england-colonies>What was the name of the New England colonies?</h2>
