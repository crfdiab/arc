<h2 id=what-parts-of-new-york-should-i-avoid>What parts of New York should I avoid?</h2>
<p>Here are the 10 most risky NYC neighborhoods</p>
<ul>
<li>Brooklyn Heights, Boerum Hill, Dumbo.</li>
<li>Chelsea and Hell’s Kitchen.</li>
<li>Bedford-Stuyvesant.</li>
<li>Downtown.</li>
<li>Fort Green and Clinton Hill.</li>
<li>Flatiron and Gramercy.</li>
<li>Brownsville.</li>
<li>Hunts Point.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id=who-owns-hells-kitchen-nyc>Who owns Hell’s Kitchen NYC?</h2>
<p>Gordon Ramsay is a British chef, restaurateur, writer, television personality and food critic. Ramsay founded his global restaurant chain, Gordon Ramsay Restaurants, in 1997. He has owned and operated a series of restaurants since he first became head chef of Aubergine in 1993.</p>
<h2 id=which-is-the-most-dangerous-neighborhood-in-nyc>Which is the most dangerous neighborhood in NYC?</h2>
<p>Looking at the list of the most dangerous neighborhoods, Brooklyn has the highest count with 8, the Bronx comes in second with 7, Manhattan follows with 5, and Queens has zero of the top 20 most dangerous neighborhoods in NYC. What particularly jumps out to us here? Well, remember what we said above about tourists and violent crime?</p>
<h2 id=which-is-the-safest-part-of-new-york-city>Which is the safest part of New York City?</h2>
<p>Some safe neighborhoods are Sutton Place, Tudor City, Carnegie Hill, Battery Park City and the Queens. Meanwhile, the best neighborhoods in Queen are mostly the safest. Sunnyside, Bayside, and Glendale. Safety cannot be over emphasized.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-most-ghetto-neighborhood-of-new-york-city>What is the most ghetto neighborhood of New York City?</h2>
<p>The most ghetto neighborhood in New York City is the South Bronx. Despite having being picked up from the 80s look, it’s still very gritty and dirty. Still many shootings, murders, and stabbing as well. There’s still vacant lots (not as many as before of course), there’s still high poverty rates and there’s plenty of projects.</p>
<h2 id=which-is-the-most-dangerous-area-in-the-bronx>Which is the most dangerous area in the Bronx?</h2>
<p>There are areas in the neighborhood to shy away from at night so you don’t get mugged. Like along Myrtle Avenue, reports of activities at corners still exist. 4. Hunts Point Back then, Hunts Point used to be registered as one of the most dangerous areas in the Bronx.</p>
