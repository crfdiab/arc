<h2 id=where-are-fossil-fuels-extracted>Where are fossil fuels extracted?</h2>
<p>Coal. The majority of all mining for fossil fuels involves the extraction of coal. Coal can be extracted close to the upper portion of the earth’s crust, called surface mining, or from deep within the earth through underground mining.</p>
<h2 id=are-fossil-fuels-easy-to-extract>Are fossil fuels easy to extract?</h2>
<p>In many parts of the world, the easy to access oil, gas and coal resources are running dry. So as global demand grows, the fossil fuel industry is pushing into resources that are harder to extract. It can mean drilling in the fragile and remote Arctic oceans or leveling entire Appalachian mountain tops to access coal.</p>
<h2 id=which-fossil-fuel-is-the-hardest-to-extract>Which fossil fuel is the hardest to extract?</h2>
<p>Petroleum, or crude oil, is harder to find and is typically a bit cleaner-burning — and, unlike coal, it can be pumped through pipelines and easily refined into fuels like gasoline or kerosene.</p>
<h2 id=how-are-fossil-fuels-extracted-from-the-ground>How are fossil fuels extracted from the ground?</h2>
<p>New technology, called “digesters,” can create natural gas from plant matter by simulating and speeding up the natural process. The Environmental Protection Agency currently believes that the burning of fossil fuels contributes to global warming.</p>
<h2 id=where-can-coal-be-extracted-from-the-earth>Where can coal be extracted from the Earth?</h2>
<p>Coal can be extracted close to the upper portion of the earth’s crust, called surface mining, or from deep within the earth through underground mining. Recovering coal through surface mining is relatively easy; shovels and bulldozers are effective at extracting coal near the surface.</p>
<h2 id=where-are-fossil-fuels-found-in-the-earth>Where are fossil fuels found in the Earth?</h2>
<p>Fossil Fuels. Fossil fuels are made from decomposing plants and animals. These fuels are found in the Earth’s crust and contain carbon and hydrogen, which can be burned for energy. Coal, oil, and natural gas are examples of fossil fuels. Coal is a material usually found in sedimentary rock deposits where rock and dead plant …</p>
<h2 id=how-are-fossil-fuels-used-in-everyday-life>How are fossil fuels used in everyday life?</h2>
<p>This is the energy that is used to heat and provide electricity to homes and businesses and to run cars and factories. Unfortunately, fossil fuels are a nonrenewable resource and waiting millions of years for new coal, oil, and natural gas deposits to form is not a realistic solution. Fossil fuels are also responsible for almost three-fourths …</p>
