<h2 id=what-type-of-ecosystem-covers-most-of-the-middle-east>What type of ecosystem covers most of the Middle East?</h2>
<p>Most of the Middle East region is charac- terized by a hot, arid and semi-arid desert climate. The Arabian Desert is the largest sand-only desert on the planet and re- ceives as little as 30 millimetres) of rainfall per year).</p>

<p>Geography</p>
<ul>
<li>Population: 368,927,551 (Source: Estimate from population of countries included)</li>
<li>Area: 2,742,000 square miles.</li>
<li>Major Biomes: desert, grasslands.</li>
<li>Major cities:</li>
<li>Bordering Bodies of Water: Mediterranean Sea, Red Sea, Gulf of Aden, Arabian Sea, Persian Gulf, Caspian Sea, Black Sea, Indian Ocean.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id=which-type-of-climate-is-most-commonly-found-in-the-middle-east>Which type of climate is most commonly found in the Middle East?</h2>
<p>Most of the Middle East outside of the tropics has the dry summer climate typical of the Mediterranean. It shares this climate also with western Australia, western portions of South America and southern Africa, and especially with the west coast of the United States.</p>
<h2 id=does-it-snow-in-the-middle-east>Does it snow in the Middle East?</h2>
<p>For the most part, the snow is confined to higher elevations in Syria, Egypt, Lebanon, Israel and the West Bank, and Jordan. Some lower-elevation desert regions in Syria are also snowy.</p>
<h2 id=where-are-the-grassland-biomes-in-the-middle-east>Where are the grassland biomes in the Middle East?</h2>
<p>Where are the grassland biomes in the Middle East? Grasslands are wide expanses of land filled with low growing plants such as grasses and wildflowers. The amount of rain is not enough to grow tall trees and produce a forest, but it is enough to not form a desert. The temperate grasslands have seasons including a hot summer and a cold winter.</p>
<h2 id=how-is-the-middle-east-desert-biome-different-from-other-biomes>How is the Middle East desert biome different from other biomes?</h2>
<p>Abiotic and Biotic Factors of the Middle East Desert. The Middle East Biome is not different from other biomes in the respect that is composed of abiotic (non-living) and biotic (living) elements.These elements interact with each other to create the Middle East deserts.Without them there wouldn’t be a Middle East desert.</p>
<h2 id=what-kind-of-climate-does-the-middle-east-have>What kind of climate does the Middle East have?</h2>
<p>As the water evaporates, salts are The hot desert biome, like that found in The Middle East, is characterised by extreme climate, thin poor soils, and a lack of biodiversity. • The climate is very hot. Summer day-time tempera- tures can exceed 40°.</p>
<h2 id=which-is-the-most-common-biome-in-the-world>Which is the most common biome in the world?</h2>
<p>This biome, despite the name, isn’t limited to the Mediterranean and is also found on the western coasts of most continents as well as coastal areas in the Middle East. A common trait of Mediterranean forests are yucca plants, wild cats, and occasionally the endangered monkey puzzle trees.</p>
