<p>The main way in that the US experience establishing trade with China was different from US attempts to open trade with Japan was that with Japan it was due to the release of sanctions.</p>
<h2 id=why-did-the-united-states-become-involved-in-the-affairs-of-some-latin-american-countries>Why did the United States become involved in the affairs of some Latin American countries?</h2>
<p>Why did the US expand its role in Latin America in the 1900’s.

<p>Why do you think the US was so successful in defeating Spain? They were successful because the natives welcomed their help and because they had such a strong naval presence during the war. What territories did the US gain as a result of the war? Guam, Puerto Rico, Cuba and the Philippines.</p>
<h2 id=when-does-the-us-trade-agreement-with-japan-come-into-force>When does the US trade agreement with Japan come into force?</h2>
<p>In October 2019, the United States and Japan signed the U.S.-Japan Trade Agreement and the U.S.-Japan Digital Trade Agreement, which entered into force on January 1, 2020.

<h2 id=how-did-the-opening-to-japan-affect-the-shogunate>How did the opening to Japan affect the shogunate?</h2>

<h2 id=why-did-the-us-and-japan-sign-a-bilateral-agreement>Why did the US and Japan sign a bilateral agreement?</h2>
