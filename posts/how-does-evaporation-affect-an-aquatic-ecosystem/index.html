<h2 id=how-does-evaporation-affect-an-aquatic-ecosystem>How does evaporation affect an aquatic ecosystem?</h2>
<p>When that water evaporates, the salt is left behind. The fresh-water vapor then condenses into clouds, many of which drift over land. Precipitation from those clouds fills lakes, rivers, and streams with fresh water.</p>
<h2 id=what-happens-to-ocean-water-when-it-evaporates>What happens to ocean water when it evaporates?</h2>
<p>Most of the water that evaporates from the oceans falls back into the oceans as precipitation. Only about 10 percent of the water evaporated from the oceans is transported over land and falls as precipitation. Once evaporated, a water molecule spends about 10 days in the air.</p>
<h2 id=how-does-the-evaporation-of-water-benefit-life>How does the evaporation of water Benefit Life?</h2>
<p>As the water evaporates, energy is taken up by the process, cooling the environment where the evaporation is taking place. In many living organisms, including humans, the evaporation of sweat, which is 90 percent water, allows the organism to cool so that homeostasis of body temperature can be maintained.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-the-effects-of-evaporation>What are the effects of evaporation?</h2>
<p>Hence, evaporation causes a cooling effect. When a liquid evaporates, the particles of the liquid absorb energy from the surroundings to compensate for the loss of energy during evaporation. Since evaporation causes cooling, this makes the surroundings cool.</p>
<h2 id=why-is-evaporation-useful>Why is evaporation useful?</h2>
<p>Evaporation is a very important part of the water cycle. Once water evaporates, it also helps form clouds. The clouds then release the moisture as rain or snow. The liquid water falls to Earth, waiting to be evaporated.</p>
<h2 id=what-happens-to-salt-during-evaporation>What happens to salt during evaporation?</h2>
<p>Show the animation: Evaporating Salt Water. The water molecules that evaporate become a gas called water vapor. Only the water evaporates, leaving the sodium and chloride ions behind. The sodium and chloride ions attract each other and re- form salt crystals.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-importance-of-evaporation>What is the importance of evaporation?</h2>
<p>Evaporation is defined as the process of liquid changing into vapor. Importance of evaporation is as follows: Perspiration cools our body through evaporation. The evaporation of liquid from the earth helps to keep the air moist and provides moisture to the clouds.</p>
<h2 id=how-important-is-evaporation-and-condensation-to-your-life>How important is evaporation and condensation to your life?</h2>
<p>Evaporation is a very important part of the water cycle. Once water evaporates, it also helps form clouds. The clouds then release the moisture as rain or snow. Condensation is crucial to the water cycle because it is responsible for the formation of clouds.</p>
<h2 id=how-is-evaporation-useful-to-us>How is evaporation useful to us?</h2>
<p>The molecules move and vibrate so quickly that they escape into the atmosphere as molecules of water vapor. Evaporation is a very important part of the water cycle. Heat from the sun, or solar energy, powers the evaporation process. Once water evaporates, it also helps form clouds.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-the-negative-effects-of-evaporation>What are the negative effects of evaporation?</h2>
<p>Increased evaporation tends to cause clouds to form low in the atmosphere, which act to reflect the sun’s warming rays back out into space.</p>
<h2 id=how-does-pollution-of-water-affect-aquatic-life>How does pollution of water affect aquatic life?</h2>
<p>In polluted water, due to abundant growth of algae, the oxygen content becomes lesser, causing the death of fishes and other organisms. It is estimated that during the last twenty years, there is a decrease of about 40 per cent in aquatic life.</p>
<h2 id=how-does-water-temperature-affect-fish-and-aquatic-life>How does water temperature affect fish and aquatic life?</h2>
<p>Water Temperature Effects on Fish and Aquatic Life &lt;&lt;&lt;…return. Changes in temperature affect aquatic life. Temperature determines which organisms will thrive and which will diminish in numbers and size. For each organism there is a thermal death point.</p>
<h2 id=how-can-evaporation-be-reduced-in-a-pond>How can evaporation be reduced in a pond?</h2>
<p>Underground storage. Evaporation will be reduced if the ratio of the surface area to the volume is reduced. The surface area can be minimized by building the pond as deep and as narrow as is practical.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-the-effects-of-changes-in-water-temperature>What are the effects of changes in water temperature?</h2>
<p>Most changes in water temperature as a result of land use activity generally trend upward. An exception is the release of cold bottom water from stratified artificial impoundments that may alter the flora and fauna for many miles downstream from a dam.</p>
