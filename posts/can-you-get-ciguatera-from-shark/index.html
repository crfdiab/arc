<h2 id=can-you-get-ciguatera-from-shark>Can you get ciguatera from shark?</h2>
<p>Ciguatera hot spots The highest human mortality rate from ciguatera poisoning (20%) is attributed to the consumption of a shark (Carcharhinus amboinensis) on the east coast of Madagascar.</p>
<h2 id=is-ciguatera-a-bacteria>Is ciguatera a bacteria?</h2>
<p>Ciguatera fish poisoning (CFP), also known simply as ciguatera, is a foodborne illness caused by eating reef fish whose flesh is contaminated with certain toxins. Such individual fish are said to be ciguatoxic….</p>

<h2 id=how-humans-can-suffer-ciguatera-from-the-consumption-of-fish>How humans can suffer ciguatera from the consumption of fish?</h2>
<p>Ciguatera fish poisoning (CFP) is a foodborne illness affecting humans worldwide. Humans acquire this illness by eating reef fish containing the naturally occurring toxins, ciguatoxins.</p>
<h2 id=can-ciguatera-be-killed-by-cooking>Can ciguatera be killed by cooking?</h2>
<p>Ciguatera toxin is harmless to fish but poisonous to humans. The toxin is odorless and tasteless, and it is heat-resistant, so cooking does not destroy the toxin.</p>
<h2 id=where-is-ciguatera-most-common>Where is ciguatera most common?</h2>
<p>Because fish are shipped around the world, you can get ciguatera anywhere. The risk is highest in fish from the Caribbean Sea and the Pacific and Indian Oceans. As many as 3 of every 100 travelers to these areas get ciguatera. The eastern Mediterranean and the western Gulf of Mexico are also areas of risk.</p>
<h2 id=does-ciguatera-go-away>Does ciguatera go away?</h2>
<p>About Ciguatera They also may find that cold things feel hot and hot things feel cold. Ciguatera has no cure. Symptoms usually go away in days or weeks but can last for years. People who have ciguatera can be treated for their symptoms.</p>
<h2 id=how-is-ciguatera-treated>How is ciguatera treated?</h2>
<p>The treatment for ciguatera fish poisoning is usually the immediate pumping out of all stomach contents (gastric lavage). If this treatment is not available, then vomiting should be induced by the administration of syrup of ipecac.</p>
<h2 id=where-are-ciguatera-fish-most-likely-to-be-found>Where are ciguatera fish most likely to be found?</h2>
<p>These fish typically inhabit low-lying shore areas or coral reefs in tropical or subtropical areas. In the United States, ciguatera fish poisoning has occurred more frequently in the last decade perhaps as a result of a general increase in fish consumption.</p>
<h2 id=how-does-ciguatera-fish-poisoning-affect-the-human-body>How does ciguatera fish poisoning affect the human body?</h2>
<p>Ciguatera fish poisoning is a rare disorder that occurs because of the ingestion of certain contaminated tropical and subtropical fish. When ingested, the toxin (ciguatoxin), which is present at high levels in these contaminated fish, may affect the digestive, muscular, and/or neurological systems.</p>
<h2 id=is-there-any-way-to-get-rid-of-ciguatera>Is there any way to get rid of ciguatera?</h2>
<p>No known method of cooking can destroy the ciguatoxin in contaminated fish. It is possible that more than one form of the toxin may be present in a fish. Ciguatera fish poisoning is a rare disease that affects males and females in equal numbers.</p>
<h2 id=why-is-ciguatera-more-soluble-in-fat-than-water>Why is ciguatera more soluble in fat than water?</h2>
<p>Ciguaterra is a toxin, not a bacterium, and a heat-resistant one, it turns out. The strange symptoms of ciguatera have to do with where it hangs out in an animal’s body. Ciguatera toxin is hydrophobic, which means it is more soluble in fats and oils than it is in water.</p>
