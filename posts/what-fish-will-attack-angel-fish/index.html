<h2 id=what-fish-will-attack-angel-fish>What fish will attack angel fish?</h2>
<p>Blackskirt Tetras – On paper, these fish seem like excellent tank mates for angelfish, but perhaps due to their body shape, they are often attacked by angelfish. Angelfish are territorial by nature, and something about blackskirt tetras seems to trigger attacks.</p>
<h2 id=why-is-my-angelfish-eating-other-fish>Why is my angelfish eating other fish?</h2>
<p>First, due to the other fish in the tank the Angel pair would be over stressed and eat their own eggs or fry. You see before the others they can eat their own. Secondly, even if they can successfully hatch the eggs, the fries would go on their own way and they are vulnerable to predation.</p>
<h2 id=what-fish-do-angelfish-not-get-along-with>What fish do angelfish not get along with?</h2>
<p>It’s best to go with fish that are at least 2 inches (5 centimeters) long. On the flipside, you also don’t want to put angelfish in with big whoppers like jaguar cichlids, Oscars or redhead cichlids.</p>
<h2 id=why-do-angelfish-kill-other-fish>Why do angelfish kill other fish?</h2>
<p>Why Are My Angelfish Attacking Each Other? When angelfish appear to be pecking or nipping at each other, it’s usually a sign of aggression, especially if you have more than 1 male in the tank. Male/female pairs will also ‘attack’ each other by locking lips or posturing/twitching usually right before spawning.</p>
<h2 id=can-i-keep-angel-fish-with-guppies>Can I Keep angel fish with guppies?</h2>
<p>Guppies. Unknown to most people, Guppies can sometime make great tank mates for Angelfish. If you plan to keep these fish together, you should introduce them while the Angelfish are young and small. This way, your Angelfish will see the Guppies as tank mates instead of food.</p>
<h2 id=can-angelfish-live-with-gourami>Can angelfish live with gourami?</h2>
<p>Angelfish and Gouramis can live together and usually get along quite nicely. They have similar tank requirements and diets.</p>
<h2 id=do-angel-fish-kill-other-fish>Do angel fish kill other fish?</h2>
<p>Angelfish are cichlids and all cichlids are territorial to some degree, especially when breeding and defending their eggs and young. However, Angelfish are quite peaceful for a cichlid and are unlikely to kill other fish in the tank.</p>
<h2 id=can-angelfish-live-with-guppies>Can angelfish live with guppies?</h2>
<h2 id=are-my-angel-fish-mating-or-fighting>Are my angel fish mating or fighting?</h2>
<p>If you know the sex of your angelfish, it will be easier to determine. Behaviors such as locking lips and following one another are typically signs of mating. But if you notice that they’re chasing each other, nipping one another, or flicking each other with their tails, this might be signs of fighting.</p>
<h2 id=what-other-fish-can-i-keep-with-guppies>What other fish can I keep with guppies?</h2>
<p>If you want to house your guppies with other fish, here are 15 fish that are compatible with guppies:</p>
<ul>
<li>Swordtails. Swordtail Fish – Wojciech J.</li>
<li>Platies. Platy Fish.</li>
<li>Mollies. Molly Fish.</li>
<li>Cory Catfish. Cory Catfish.</li>
<li>Honey Gouramis. Honey Gourami (source)</li>
<li>Harlequin Rasboras.</li>
<li>Cardinal Tetra.</li>
<li>Bristlenose Pleco.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id=what-kind-of-food-does-a-french-angelfish-eat>What kind of food does a French angelfish eat?</h2>
<p>French angelfish are foragers and eat a variety of sessile invertebrates and plants, including sponges, algae, soft corals, tunicates, and others. Juveniles clean parasites and loose scales off of large fishes, including some that are predatory.</p>
<h2 id=what-kind-of-fish-are-good-with-angel-fish>What kind of fish are good with angel fish?</h2>
<p>Small cichlids like rams, Krib’s cichlids and keyholes, corydoras catfish,other peaceful bottom feeders, bleeding heart tetra, blackfin tetra, congo tetra, barbs, pencil fish, leperinus, rams, krebensis, firemouth, festivum, port cichlid, keyhole cichlid, metynnis, discus, hatchet fish, almost any kind of catfish, most large live bearers.</p>
<h2 id=what-kind-of-tank-does-an-angel-fish-need>What kind of tank does an angel fish need?</h2>
<p>Choose to cultivate angelfish-only tanks. In fact, angelfish tend to do best when kept in groups of 5 or more of their own species. 5. Angelfish have very long, delicate fins which can easily be damaged or torn if other fish nip at them.</p>
<h2 id=where-can-i-find-a-lemonpeel-angel-fish>Where can I find a lemonpeel angel fish?</h2>
<p>The Lemonpeel Angel Fish (Centropyge flavissima), is an omnivorous marine angelfish. It is also referred to as the Dwarf or Pygmy Angelfish. Lemonpeel Angel Fish are found in the Indo-Pacific region, however, several of these fish have been reported to inhabit the reef near He’eia Pier in Kaneohe Bay in Hawaii.</p>
