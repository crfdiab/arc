<h2 id=how-does-smoking-pollute-the-air>How does smoking pollute the air?</h2>
<p>Burning typically releases particles and chemicals into the air. When trash is burned, including plastics, coated papers, and chemical products, additional cancer-causing pollutants and higher levels of particulate matter are released in the smoke.</p>
<h2 id=how-much-does-cigarette-smoke-contribute-to-air-pollution>How much does cigarette smoke contribute to air pollution?</h2>
<p>Cigarette smoke produces 10 times more air pollution than diesel car exhaust. The air pollution emitted by cigarettes is 10 times greater than diesel car exhaust, suggests a controlled experiment, reported in Tobacco Control.</p>
<h2 id=how-does-smoking-cause-damage>How does smoking cause damage?</h2>
<p>Smoking can cause lung disease by damaging your airways and the small air sacs (alveoli) found in your lungs. Lung diseases caused by smoking include COPD, which includes emphysema and chronic bronchitis. Cigarette smoking causes most cases of lung cancer.</p>
<h2 id=how-can-you-tell-if-someone-is-a-smoker>How can you tell if someone is a smoker?</h2>
<p>Besides the confirmatory evidence (a person actually smoking a cigarette in public view), nicotine-stained fingers and teeth, the characteristic smell of smoke impregnated clothing and household items, the chronic “smokers cough,” the gravelly voice, and often the visible pack of cigarettes and lighter in a person’s …</p>
<h2 id=does-smoking-affect-hair>Does smoking affect hair?</h2>
<p>Smoking tobacco can potentially damage your hair follicles and increase your risk of developing hair loss. Smoking may also cause oxidative stress and reduced blood flow to your hair follicles that may contribute to hair loss.</p>
<h2 id=how-does-smoking-affect-the-environment-and-health>How does smoking affect the environment and health?</h2>
<p>Smoking Environmental Risks. And as if that wasn’t enough, every year researchers find more and more evidence that smoking, and the tobacco industry in general, are harming the planet we live on, causing irreparable damage to ecosystems, polluting water, land, and air and pushing Earth towards a global cataclysm.</p>
<h2 id=how-is-the-tobacco-industry-harmful-to-the-environment>How is the tobacco industry harmful to the environment?</h2>
<p>If the soil remains fertile, there is a risk that whatever grows in the contaminated patch will also contain chemicals, making the crops dangerous for consumption. The cigarette and tobacco production industry can also be harmful to agriculture.</p>
<h2 id=how-does-second-hand-smoke-affect-the-environment>How does second hand smoke affect the environment?</h2>
<p>If nothing else, this all goes to show that a tobacco-free world would be greener, too. Second-hand smoke is widely recognized as a cause of disease in both humans and animals, but for the issue of smoking and the environment, the most important impact is how it affects air quality overall.</p>
<h2 id=how-does-banning-smoking-affect-the-air-quality>How does banning smoking affect the air quality?</h2>
<p>Abundant evidence from various sources show marked improvements in air quality when smoking is banned. For example, when New York instituted a state-wide smoke-free law, levels of fine particulate matter in 20 locations studied decreased by 84%, and many other locations show similar results around the world.</p>
