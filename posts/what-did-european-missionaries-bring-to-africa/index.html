<h2 id=what-did-european-missionaries-bring-to-africa>What did European missionaries bring to Africa?</h2>
<p>– it was the missionaries who provided Christianity and education; these gave Africans access to the ideas and ideologies in western societies.</p>
<h2 id=what-impact-did-missionaries-have-on-africa>What impact did missionaries have on Africa?</h2>
<p>The effects of missionaries on West Africa included a loss of cultural identity, a change in the unity of West Africa, an increase of nationalism, and a spread of Christianity due to trained black missionaries.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-role-of-missionaries-in-the-colonization-of-africa>What was the role of missionaries in the colonization of Africa?</h2>
<p>Summary. Missionaries on the continent, who predominantly came from Portugal, France, Great Britain and Germany; travelled to African colonies under the premise of converting local communities to Christianity.</p>
<h2 id=who-were-missionaries-and-what-did-they-do>Who were missionaries and what did they do?</h2>
<p>Missionaries go into a community to teach about Jesus Christ and the Christian faith. Missionary work depends on where the individual or group of missionaries are going (international or local communities). At the very least, a missionary’s first responsibility is to God, then to his or her church or missions agency.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-purpose-of-missionaries>What is the purpose of missionaries?</h2>
<p>A missionary is a member of a religious group sent into an area to promote their faith or perform ministries of service, such as education, literacy, social justice, health care, and economic development.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-impact-of-missionaries>What is the impact of missionaries?</h2>
<p>Woodberry (2004, 2007, and 2012) found that missionary activity could have a positive impact on economic development—especially in terms of education, gender equality, and democracy—when the missionary activity focuses on investing in the human capital of the populace.</p>
<h2 id=who-was-the-first-woman-missionary-in-the-bible>Who was the first woman missionary in the Bible?</h2>
<p>The early Christian texts refer to various women activists in the early church. One such woman was St. Priscilla, a Jewish missionary from Rome, who may have helped found the Christian community at Corinth. She traveled as a missionary with her husband and St Paul, and tutored the Jewish intellectual Apollos.</p>
<h2 id=do-missionaries-get-paid>Do missionaries get paid?</h2>
<p>Missionary annual salary ranges from ​$20,000​ up to ​$68,000​. Missionaries raise added money for their work by finding sponsors, which can make a large financial difference. However, the primary drive to carry out missionary work is religious, not financial.</p>
<h2 id=when-did-european-missionaries-come-to-southern-africa>When did European missionaries come to Southern Africa?</h2>
<p>The United Missionary Conference reports for 1884 consistently show that all these practices were still prevalent throughout southern Africa despite a missionary presence in some areas dating back over four generations (United Missionary Conference 1889). After Williams had conducted his research in the 1950s he also concluded that:</p>
<h2 id=why-did-the-europeans-come-to-southern-africa>Why did the Europeans come to Southern Africa?</h2>
<p>(Warneck 1888) European missionaries to southern Africa during the nineteenth and twentieth centuries played a strangely ambiguous role in the history and affairs of the region. On the one hand they were driven by a strong desire to genuinely serve humanity and bring about material and social changes which would improve its quality of life.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-role-of-the-european-missionary>What was the role of the European missionary?</h2>
<p>First the missionary builds a simple small house for himself, to which he soon adds a school and a church. Generally he must himself superintend this work; often enough, indeed, he must execute it with his own hand, and it stands him in good stead to have been a tradesman at home.</p>
<h2 id=who-was-the-first-european-missionary-in-lesotho>Who was the first European missionary in Lesotho?</h2>
<p>The first of these was founded, naturally enough, by the Paris Missionary Society at Morija, Lesotho, in 1841, but others soon followed this example. Lovedale in 1857, St Matthews in 1876, Leloaleng in 1879, Amanzimtoti in 1883 and Blythswood in 1884 were but a few (Dennis 1902).</p>
