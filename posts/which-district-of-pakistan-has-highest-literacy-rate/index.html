<p>10th<br>
According to Global Firepower, the Pakistan Armed Forces are ranked as the 10th most powerful military in the world.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-adult-literacy-rate-in-pakistan>What is the adult literacy rate in Pakistan?</h2>
<p>Adult literacy rate is the percentage of people ages 15 and above who can both read and write with understanding a short simple statement about their everyday life. Pakistan literacy rate for 2017 was 59.13%, a 2.15% increase from 2014. Pakistan literacy rate for 2014 was 56.98%, a 1.38% increase from 2013.</p>
<h2 id=which-is-the-lowest-literacy-rate-in-the-world>Which is the lowest literacy rate in the world?</h2>
<p>Pakistan has ignored education, which is the most vital element for the success and development of any nation; this has resulted in one of the lowest literacy rate in world: Pakistan’s literacy rate is ranked 113 in a total of 120 countries.</p>
<h2 id=why-are-there-so-many-illiterates-in-pakistan>Why are there so many illiterates in Pakistan?</h2>
<p>Education is the effort of state and government, who should do everything in their means, in keeping with national resources, to provide on-going funding. The community should also play a role in educational development. Pakistan has the highest concentration of illiterates of any country.</p>
<h2 id=which-is-the-country-with-the-highest-concentration-of-illiterates>Which is the country with the highest concentration of illiterates?</h2>
<p>Pakistan has the highest concentration of illiterates of any country. Illiteracy is not only an individual disability but also has an impact on society. Democratic institutions and values can hardly flourish in a society where half of the adult population is illiterate and where the majority voters cannot access information or read newspapers.</p>
