<h2 id=what-are-the-reasons-for-africas-ongoing-conflicts>What are the reasons for Africa’s ongoing conflicts?</h2>

<h2 id=how-did-world-war-ii-affect-colonialism>How did World War II affect colonialism?</h2>

<h2 id=is-ethiopia-a-bad-country>Is Ethiopia a bad country?</h2>

<h2 id=why-did-african-countries-gain-independence-in-1960>Why did African countries gain independence in 1960?</h2>

<h2 id=when-did-all-the-british-colonies-in-africa-become-independent>When did all the British colonies in Africa become independent?</h2>
