<h2 id=why-is-access-to-the-ocean-important>Why is access to the ocean important?</h2>
<p>Information from ocean exploration can help us understand how we are affecting and being affected by changes in Earth’s environment, including changes in weather and climate. Insights from ocean exploration can help us better understand and respond to earthquakes, tsunamis, and other hazards.</p>
<h2 id=how-important-is-the-ocean-to-our-economy>How important is the ocean to our economy?</h2>
<p>In addition to its crucial role for regulating the climate and weather, the ocean is vital to the world’s economy, with more than 90% of trade using sea routes and as a source of jobs for millions of people.</p>
<h2 id=why-are-oceans-important-in-human-geography>Why are oceans important in human geography?</h2>
<p>Consequently, humanity is losing the food, jobs, and critical environmental services that a healthy ocean generates. Covering 72 percent of the Earth and supplying half its oxygen, the ocean is our planet’s life support system. This video dives into why the ocean is important and some of the biggest threats it faces.</p>
<h2 id=why-are-oceans-important-to-the-earths-environments>Why are oceans important to the Earth’s environments?</h2>
<p>The air we breathe: The ocean produces over half of the world’s oxygen and absorbs 50 times more carbon dioxide than our atmosphere. Climate regulation: Covering 70 percent of the Earth’s surface, the ocean transports heat from the equator to the poles, regulating our climate and weather patterns.</p>
<h2 id=what-problems-is-the-ocean-facing>What problems is the ocean facing?</h2>
<p>Global warming is causing sea levels to rise, threatening coastal population centers. Many pesticides and nutrients used in agriculture end up in the coastal waters, resulting in oxygen depletion that kills marine plants and shellfish. Factories and industrial plants discharge sewage and other runoff into the oceans.</p>
<h2 id=which-ocean-is-important-for-transporting-goods>Which ocean is important for transporting goods?</h2>
<p>the Indian Ocean<br>
Petroleum dominates commerce, as the Indian Ocean has come to be an important throughway for transport of crude oil to Europe, North America, and East Asia.</p>
<h2 id=what-jobs-rely-on-the-ocean>What jobs rely on the ocean?</h2>
<p>12 ocean-related jobs</p>
<ul>
<li>Lifeguard.</li>
<li>Deckhand.</li>
<li>Marine technician.</li>
<li>Ocean import manager.</li>
<li>Marine biologist.</li>
<li>Commercial diver.</li>
<li>Ship captain.</li>
<li>Marine manager.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id=is-our-ocean-in-danger>Is our ocean in danger?</h2>
<p>Pollution, over-fishing and over-hunting, mining, the destruction of the oceans’ richest areas, the massive occupation of the coasts and the alteration of their chemical composition and temperature are leaving a mark that is difficult to erase. …</p>
<h2 id=what-will-happen-to-our-oceans-if-we-keep-polluting>What will happen to our oceans if we keep polluting?</h2>
<p>Climate change is causing the oceans to get hotter, and even small temperature increases are resulting in the ocean’s coral becoming bleached, as we mentioned earlier. A study in Science journal has found that almost every coral reef will be dying by 2100 if carbon dioxide emissions are not reduced.</p>
<h2 id=which-is-a-landlocked-country-with-no-boat-access>Which is a landlocked country with no boat access?</h2>
<p>Luxembourg has such through the Moselle, but Liechtenstein has no boat access, even though it is located along the Rhine, as the Rhine is not navigable that far upstream. The Mekong is an international waterway so that landlocked Laos has access to the South China Sea (since Laos became independent from French Indochina ).</p>
<h2 id=why-does-water-security-matter-to-global-security>Why does water security matter to global security?</h2>
<p>The simple act of handwashing can reduce the spread of infectious diseases by 50 percent. But good hygiene practices require access to clean water, something that poorer countries struggle with. More than 800 million people worldwide do not have access to clean water.</p>
<h2 id=which-is-landlocked-country-has-access-to-south-china-sea>Which is landlocked country has access to South China Sea?</h2>
<p>The Mekong is an international waterway so that landlocked Laos has access to the South China Sea (since Laos became independent from French Indochina ). However, it is not navigable above the Khone Phapheng Falls. Free ports allow transshipment to short-distance ships or river vessels.</p>
<h2 id=how-does-the-law-of-the-sea-apply>How does the Law of the Sea apply?</h2>
<p>Law of the Sea. …coastal country may establish an exclusive economic zone (EEZ) extending 200 nautical miles (370 km) from shore. Within the EEZ the coastal state has the right to exploit and regulate fisheries, construct artificial islands and installations, use the zone for other economic purposes (e.g., the generation of energy from waves),….</p>
