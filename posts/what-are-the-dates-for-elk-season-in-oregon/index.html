<h2 id=how-many-elk-can-you-kill-in-oregon>How many elk can you kill in Oregon?</h2>
<p>one elk<br>
All the general rile elk seasons take place in October and November. Archery elk hunting is general season nearly statewide and coincides with general archery deer season. The bag limit is “one elk” in many units. It opens on a Saturday in late August and runs 30 days, ending on a Sunday in late September.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-considered-a-spike-elk-in-oregon>What is considered a spike elk in Oregon?</h2>
<p>Adding to the general hunter’s difficulty, some yearling bulls are not legal. State rules define a spike as having no more than one point on one side of its antlers. An antler point is a branch measuring 1 inch or longer. But points don’t count if they are within 4 inches of the skull.</p>
<h2 id=what-state-has-the-highest-success-rate-for-elk-hunting>What state has the highest success rate for elk hunting?</h2>
<p>Wyoming<br>
Wyoming claims an amazing overall 44.4% average hunter success rate (includes OTC tags), followed now by Utah at 26.4% (Utah is always late, so waiting on 2017 harvest data). Idaho dropped to third place followed by Montana.</p>
<h2 id=what-time-of-day-are-elk-most-active>What time of day are elk most active?</h2>

Time of Day: Elk, like many animals, are most active during the morning and evening hours. Middle of the day hunts may be effective during the rut, but if you are looking for the most activity, shoot for early morning and dusk.</p>
<h2 id=is-it-legal-to-shoot-a-spike-in-oregon>Is it legal to shoot a spike in Oregon?</h2>
