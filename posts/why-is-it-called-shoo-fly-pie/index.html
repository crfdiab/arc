<h2 id=why-is-it-called-shoo-fly-pie>Why is it called Shoo Fly pie?</h2>
<p>According to some, the name of this popular molasses-flavored treat comes from the days of old when bakers would have to “shoo” flies away from their pies cooling on the windowsill. “The pie takes its name from Shoofly the Boxing Mule, who was part of a popular traveling circus act in the Dutch Country,” he says.</p>
<h2 id=can-you-freeze-shoo-fly-pie>Can you freeze shoo fly pie?</h2>
<p>Yes! Shoofly Pie freezes well. Again, just keep in mind the crumb topping will thaw out and be less crisp.</p>

<p>Dutch Haven<br>
Since 1946, Dutch Haven has been famous for America’s best Shoo-Fly Pie, and today this wet bottom pie is still produced from the original recipe! Of the thousands of our delicious pies that are sold each year, many are shipped throughout the country.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-the-ingredients-in-a-shoo-fly-pie>What are the ingredients in a Shoo Fly Pie?</h2>
<p>Shoofly pie is put together in a really interesting way. There are two basic components: a lean streusel (by lean, I mean it’s made without too much fat) and a molasses and egg syrup. Seems like there is no one right way to make a shoo fly pie.</p>
<h2 id=how-do-you-make-a-wet-bottom-shoofly-pie>How do you make a wet bottom Shoofly pie?</h2>
<p>For crumb mixture: Mix flour, brown sugar, salt, baking soda, & cream of tartar in a mixing bowl. Add butter (cut in slices) and shortening. Using pastry blender, mix until fine crumbs. Reserve 1 1/2 c. of the crumb mixture to put on top. Pour about a 3/4 c. of the wet mixture into the crust bottom of each pie dish.</p>

<p>Note to be very careful when placing your shoo fly pie in the oven. The filling will be very liquid and could easily spill. The filling will set up during baking. I hope you love this Amish shoo fly pie recipe as much as my family does! This authentic shoo fly pie is a delicious Amish family recipe that you’re sure to fall in love with!</p>
<h2 id=what-kind-of-food-was-shoofly-pie-made-out-of>What kind of food was Shoofly pie made out of?</h2>
<p>Shoofly Pie was created out of everyday food staples that were readily available; the Amish and Pennsylvania Dutch are frugal people and have a history of creating delicious foods from meager supplies. Shoofly Pie is often eaten for breakfast along with a cup of coffee.</p>
