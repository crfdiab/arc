<h2 id=which-five-states-use-the-most-geothermal-energy-in-the-united-states>Which five states use the most geothermal energy in the United States?</h2>
<p>Electricity generated from geothermal plants is projected to increase from 16 billion kWh in 2019 to 52.2 billion kWh in 2050. In 2016, California, Nevada, Utah, and Hawaii were the states with the most installed geothermal energy capacity.</p>
<h2 id=is-there-geothermal-energy-in-the-us>Is there geothermal energy in the US?</h2>
<p>The United States leads the world in the amount of geothermal electricity generation. In 2020, there were geothermal power plants in seven states, which produced about 17 billion kilowatthours (kWh), equal to 0.4% of total U.S. utility-scale electricity generation.</p>
<h2 id=how-many-geothermal-power-plants-are-in-the-us>How many geothermal power plants are in the US?</h2>
<p>There are currently 64 operating conventional geothermal power plants in the United States, accounting for nearly 2,700 megawatts (MW) of total capacity at the end of 2013.</p>
<h2 id=which-state-in-the-us-would-be-best-for-a-geothermal-plant>Which state in the US would be best for a geothermal plant?</h2>
<p>Most of the geothermal power plants in the United States are in western states and Hawaii, where geothermal energy resources are close to the earth’s surface. California generates the most electricity from geothermal energy.</p>
<h2 id=which-state-has-the-most-geothermal>Which state has the most geothermal?</h2>
<p>California<br>
California is home to the greatest number of geothermal power plants in the United States. As of 2019, there were 30 such plants operated by electric utilities in the state. Nevada followed, with 23 geothermal power plants.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-3-drawbacks-of-geothermal>What are 3 drawbacks of geothermal?</h2>
<p>Cons of geothermal energy: generates waste, reservoirs require proper management, it’s location-specific, has high initial cost, and can cause earthquakes in extreme cases. Geothermal has the potential to become a major global energy source, but is held back by its high upfront costs.</p>
<h2 id=what-country-has-2-or-more-geothermal-power-plants>What country has 2 or more geothermal power plants?</h2>
<p>Analysts have estimated that Indonesia will overtake the US in terms of geothermal capacity by 2027. The country is currently home to four of the world’s top 10 geothermal power projects, including the two biggest plants by active capacity.</p>
<h2 id=where-are-geothermal-power-plants-located-in-the-united-states>Where are geothermal power plants located in the United States?</h2>
<p>S. geothermal power plants are located in the West. Most of the geothermal power plants in the United States are in western states and Hawaii, where geothermal energy resources are close to the earth’s surface. California generates the most electricity from geothermal energy.</p>
<h2 id=how-many-megawatts-of-geothermal-energy-does-california-have>How many megawatts of geothermal energy does California have?</h2>
<p>California’s location on the Pacific ring of fire and the existence of several tectonic plate conjunctions in the state provide ideal conditions for geothermal energy generation. In 2018, the state had an installed geothermal capacity of 2,792 megawatts.</p>
<h2 id=how-many-geothermal-power-plants-are-there-in-nevada>How many geothermal power plants are there in Nevada?</h2>
<p>Like California, Nevada is also a hotbed of geothermal activity. The northern part of the state primarily hosts the geothermal electricity generation plants with 26 plants distributed at 17 locations. In 2018, Nevada had an installed geothermal capacity of 805 megawatts.</p>
<h2 id=how-much-power-does-geothermal-energy-produce-per-year>How much power does geothermal energy produce per year?</h2>
<p>When developed, these projects could potentially supply up to 3,979 MW of power, meeting the needs of about 4 million homes. At this rate of development, geothermal production in the United States could exceed 15,000 MW by 2025.</p>
