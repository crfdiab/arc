<h2 id=how-is-the-weather-in-south-america-in-november>How is the weather in South America in November?</h2>
<p>South America in November experiences hot and sunny days with almost complete cloudy sky. Typically temperature fluctuates around 28℃ and wind is light breeze.</p>
<h2 id=what-major-events-happened-in-south-america>What major events happened in South America?</h2>
<p>The 10 Most Important Events in the History of Latin America</p>

<li>Papal Bull Inter Caetera/Treaty of Tordesillas.</li>
<li>Conquest of the Aztec and Inca Empires.</li>
<li>Independence from Spain and Portugal.</li>
<li>The Mexican-American War.</li>
<li>The War of the Triple Alliance.</li>
<li>The War of the Pacific.</li>
<li>The Construction of the Panama Canal.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id=does-south-america-have-a-winter>Does South America have a winter?</h2>
<p>Other than that South America is a year round destination where the summer season takes place from November to February and the winter season lasts from June to August. Just remember that the southern hemisphere seasons are reversed if you’re looking for the best time to visit South America.</p>
<h2 id=is-november-a-good-time-to-visit-brazil>Is November a good time to visit Brazil?</h2>
<p>Brazil’s summer is Dec-Mar, and winter Jun-Sep – but heat and humidity rise the further north you go. Overall, Sep-Oct is the best time to visit Brazil – avoiding major vacation periods, the chilly southern winter and soggy season in the Pantanal – as well as enjoying cheaper prices.</p>
<h2 id=is-november-a-good-time-to-go-to-peru>Is November a good time to go to Peru?</h2>
<p>November is still a good time to visit Peru’s interior with few crowds and many chances of great weather. Rates and prices in general start to lower for the slow season but it’s still a good idea to book your tours and accommodations in advance if you’re visiting during this time.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-the-latest-news-from-south-america>What are the latest news from South America?</h2>
<p>While the world tries to stay apart, pictures show prisoners in El Salvador shoved together in lockdown after 22 murders took place. Recently freed drug smuggler Cassie Sainsbury is considering IVF to start a family with her new fiance who she met while in a Colombian prison.</p>
<h2 id=which-is-the-most-popular-festival-in-south-america>Which is the most popular festival in South America?</h2>
<p>Street parties, nightly samba contests, float parades, amazing costumes and an endless supply of food and drinks (not to mention non-stop music) set the mood for what is widely hailed as ‘the party of the year’. Of all the festivals in South America, this is undoubtedly the one that attracts the largest crowds.</p>
<h2 id=where-does-carnival-take-place-in-south-america>Where does Carnival take place in South America?</h2>
<p>The whole continent is gripped by Carnival fever this month, the most famous and outlandish celebrations taking place in Brazil. In Salvador de Bahia and (more famously) Rio de Janeiro, sensational 4-day-long celebrations turn already-vibrant cities into magnificent party scenes.</p>
<h2 id=what-to-expect-when-backpacking-in-south-america>What to expect when backpacking in South America?</h2>
<p>When backpacking South America, one minute you’re at sea level and then a 12-hour bus ride later you’re at the highest administrative city in the world. But one thing that never changed for me was the kindness, patience and generosity that we experienced from people along the way. It never faltered, not once!</p>
