<h2 id=did-the-us-want-to-annex-hawaii>Did the US want to annex Hawaii?</h2>
<p>On February 1, Minister John Stevens recognized Dole’s new government on his own authority and proclaimed Hawaii a U.S. protectorate. Dole submitted a treaty of annexation to the U.S. Senate, but most Democrats opposed it, especially after it was revealed that most Hawaiians did not want annexation.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-the-annexation-of-hawaii-benefit-the-united-states>How did the annexation of Hawaii benefit the United States?</h2>
<p>The United States decided to proceed with the annexation of Hawaii in 1898. This action extended the territory of the U.S. deep into the Pacific, creating an economic integration with the islands that helped the nation begin its rise as a superpower in the region.</p>
<h2 id=why-did-the-united-states-annex-hawaii-to-the-us>Why did the United States annex Hawaii to the US?</h2>
<p>Also, the United States established a U.S. naval base at Pearl Harbor in the late 1880s. The sugar growing industry is where the annexation of Hawaii started to begin or was the root cause of the annexation.</p>
<h2 id=how-many-people-signed-the-petition-against-the-annexation-of-hawaii>How many people signed the petition against the annexation of Hawaii?</h2>
<p>The petition, clearly marked “Petition Against Annexation” and written in both the Hawaiian and English languages, was signed by 21,269 native Hawaiian people, or more than half the 39,000 native Hawaiians and mixed-blood persons reported by the Hawaiian Commission census for the same year.</p>
<h2 id=what-president-annexed-hawaii>What president annexed Hawaii?</h2>
<p>Spurred by the nationalism aroused by the Spanish-American War, the United States annexed Hawaii in 1898 at the urging of President William McKinley. Hawaii was made a territory in 1900, and Dole became its first governor.</p>
<h2 id=why-was-queen-liliuokalani-against-the-annexation-of-hawaii>Why was Queen Liliuokalani against the annexation of Hawaii?</h2>
<p>Queen Liliuokalani tried to rebuild the monarchy and was against the annexation with the United States. Many of the local sugar farmers were plotting a revolt to defeat the Queen because of her opposition to the annexation. American troops invaded the island without the consent from the President of the United States.</p>
