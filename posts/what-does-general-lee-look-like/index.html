<p>The short answer: Racing regulations. Their Dodge Charger “The General Lee” was built as a race car, which was a common tactic for actual moonshiners. According to the Wikipedia entry, it is explained in the series that the doors of race cars are welded shut because it’s a race race.</p>
<h2 id=does-kid-rock-own-the-general-lee>Does Kid Rock own the General Lee?</h2>
