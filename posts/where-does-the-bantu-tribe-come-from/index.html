<h2 id=where-does-the-bantu-tribe-come-from>Where does the Bantu tribe come from?</h2>
<p>Bantu peoples are the speakers of Bantu languages, comprising several hundred indigenous ethnic groups in Africa, spread over a vast area from Central Africa across the African Great Lakes to Southern Africa.</p>
<h2 id=where-did-the-bantu-migrate-to-and-from>Where did the Bantu migrate to and from?</h2>
<p>The migration of the Bantu people from their origins in southern West Africa saw a gradual population movement sweep through the central, eastern, and southern parts of the continent starting in the mid-2nd millennium BCE and finally ending before 1500 CE.</p>
<h2 id=who-are-the-ancestors-of-the-bantu>Who are the ancestors of the Bantu?</h2>
<p>The earliest Bantu people arose in modern-day Cameroon and Nigeria. A Neolithic people who farmed yams and oil palms (but not grains), they lived on the edges of forests where resources were richer and they could supplement their diet with bushmeat.</p>

<h2 id=where-did-the-ancestors-of-the-bantu-come-from>Where did the ancestors of the Bantu come from?</h2>
<p>According to the Wikipedia article ‘Bantu peoples,’ the ancestors of the Bantu once lived in Cameroon and eastern Nigeria. Between 2500 and 3000 years ago, these ancient Bantu people began a series of migrations that brought them into central, southern and southeastern Africa, where they displaced Khoi-San people.</p>
<h2 id=what-kind-of-languages-do-the-bantu-people-speak>What kind of languages do the Bantu people speak?</h2>
<p>Over time, a number of languages, including Swahili, Kirundi, Gikuyu, Tsonga, and Basaa, developed; many of these languages share the word “Bantu” for people, and except for a region in South-East Africa where Khoi-San is spoken, they cover Southern Africa. The term “bantu” is often considered racially offensive in South Africa.</p>
<h2 id=how-many-bantu-people-live-in-sub-saharan-africa>How many Bantu people live in Sub Saharan Africa?</h2>
<p>If you went back in time 5,000 years, they would only be a few hundred thousand Bantu people learning to farm on the Western side of Africa. Bantu speakers w number about 60 million, and most of of sub Saharan Africa now speaks some version of the Niger-Congo language family. This was different to how farming spread in Europe.</p>
<h2 id=where-are-the-bantu-provinces-in-south-africa>Where are the Bantu provinces in South Africa?</h2>
<p>A province of South Africa that was created in 1994 when the Zulu bantustan of KwaZulu (“Place of the Zulu” in Zulu) and Natal Province were merged. It is located in the southeast of the country, enjoying a long shoreline beside the Indian Ocean and sharing borders with three other provinces and the countries of Mozambique, Swaziland, and Lesotho.</p>
