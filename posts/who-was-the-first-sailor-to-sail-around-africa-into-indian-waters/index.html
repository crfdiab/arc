<p>In 1497, explorer Vasco da Gama was commissioned by the Portuguese king to find a maritime route to the East. His success in doing so proved to be one of the more instrumental moments in the history of navigation. He subsequently made two other voyages to India and was appointed as Portuguese viceroy in India in 1524.</p>

<p>Vasco da Gama<br>
Vasco da Gama was a Portuguese explorer who followed in the footsteps of Dias and became the first European to sail around the southern tip of Africa and all the way to India. Da Gama sailed from Lisbon, Portugal in July 1497, with four ships.</p>

<p>Christopher Columbus’ unsuccessful search for a western maritime route to India resulted in the “discovery” of the Americas in 1492, but it was Vasco da Gama who ultimately established the Carreira da India, or India Route, when he sailed around Africa and into the Indian Ocean, landing at Calicut (modern Kozhikode).</p>

<p>Portuguese explorer. In 1497-1498 he led the first naval expedition from Europe to sail to India, opening an important commercial sea route. In 1519, Magellan’s expedition left Spain. After much hardship, it rounded the tip of South America and entered the Pacific Ocean.</p>

<p>Portuguese explorer who in 1488 led the first expedition to sail around the southern tip of Africa from the Atlantic and sight the Indian Ocean. (p. 428) Vasco da Gama</p>
<h2 id=when-did-vasco-da-gama-discover-the-sea-route-to-india>When did Vasco da Gama discover the sea route to India?</h2>
<p>The discovery of the sea route to India is the description sometimes used in Europe and among the Portuguese for the first recorded trip made directly from Europe to India via the Atlantic Ocean. It was undertaken under the command of Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama during the reign of King Manuel I in 1497–1499.</p>

<p>We consider them to be the first to discover America, the Indian and Pacific Oceans. The Portuguese sailor Ferdinand Magellan is credited as being the first man to sail around the world. He was appointed commander of a fleet of five ships by king Carlos V of Spain at the beginning of the 16th. century.</p>
