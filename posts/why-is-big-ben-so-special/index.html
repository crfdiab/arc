<p>Big Ben is a tower clock known for its accuracy and for its massive hour bell. Strictly speaking, the name refers only to the bell, which weighs 15.1 tons (13.7 metric tons), but it is commonly associated with the whole clock tower at the northern end of the Houses of Parliament, in the London borough of Westminster.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-purpose-of-the-big-ben-tower>What is the purpose of the Big Ben tower?</h2>
<p>Elizabeth Tower, originally referred to as the Clock Tower, but more popularly known as Big Ben, was raised as a part of Charles Barry’s design for a new Palace of Westminster, after the old palace was largely destroyed by fire on 16 October 1834.</p>
<h2 id=how-does-the-clock-in-big-ben-work>How does the clock in Big Ben work?</h2>
<p>Instead, Big Ben uses a novel temperature-compensating pendulum, made from concentric tubes of zinc and steel. These two metals expand and contract at different rates and, because of the way they are connected, ensure that the pendulum length remains constant whatever the temperature.</p>
<h2 id=why-was-the-clock-tower-of-big-ben-built>Why was the clock tower of Big Ben built?</h2>
<p>The clock tower of Big Ben is a one of the most famous monuments in London. Big Ben has been a world-famous symbol of British culture ever since it first rang out on May 31, 1859.</p>

<p>This clock is one of London’s famous landmarks, and its distinctive chimes are recognized worldwide. Big Ben is its name—although that name originally referred only to its largest bell. This world-famous clock is a marvel of engineering. Work on the 316-foot [96 m] clock tower began in 1843.</p>

<p>Big Ben’s clock tower has gone by several names. Even though it has assumed the Big Ben moniker, the tower has its own official name. For the bulk of its life, the landmark was known simply as the Clock Tower, but it was commonly referenced (especially by the Victorian press) as St. Stephen’s Tower.</p>
