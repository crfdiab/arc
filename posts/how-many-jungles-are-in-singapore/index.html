<p>Today, you’re more likely to see a squirrel scuttle across your path than come face-to-face with a tiger (sadly, Singapore’s last tiger was shot in the 1930s) but there are still places you can visit to get a taste of the jungle in the city. Here are our top five. Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve, Singapore. Image by Schristia / CC BY-SA 2.0</p>
