<h2 id=which-countries-celebrate-thanksgiving-day>Which countries celebrate Thanksgiving Day?</h2>
<p>Thanksgiving is a national holiday celebrated on various dates in the United States, Canada, Grenada, Saint Lucia, and Liberia. It began as a day of giving thanks and sacrifice for the blessing of the harvest and of the preceding year. Similarly named festival holidays occur in Germany and Japan.</p>
<h2 id=does-the-uk-have-a-thanksgiving-holiday>Does the UK have a Thanksgiving holiday?</h2>
<p>The American thanksgiving is not celebrated in the UK because no one had to be thankful for their new land and good ocean trip. However, the harvest part of it is still celebrated by many churches and most schools.</p>
<h2 id=do-they-celebrate-thanksgiving-in-germany>Do they celebrate Thanksgiving in Germany?</h2>
<p>Meaning of “Erntedank” in Germany At the same date as in Canada, the Germans celebrate their Thanksgiving (Erntedankfest). During the celebration, which is usually held in a church but also regionally as a procession, crops, cereals, and fruit are decoratively arranged.</p>
<h2 id=is-thanksgiving-only-a-us-holiday>Is Thanksgiving only a US holiday?</h2>
<p>Thanksgiving is an annual national holiday in the United States and Canada celebrating the harvest and other blessings of the past year.</p>
<h2 id=why-do-we-not-celebrate-thanksgiving>Why do we not celebrate Thanksgiving?</h2>
<p>But some members of Congress objected, asserting that the authority to designate a day of thanks belonged to individual state governors, not the president. Others argued that Thanksgiving was a “religious matter.” Therefore, the government’s establishment of a national thanksgiving was forbidden by the First Amendment.</p>

<p>There’s really no one meal for this holiday that’s served throughout Germany. For us, and for most Germans, it was what we all liked the best. And, that’s rouladen, red cabbage, and potato dumplings with lots and lots of wonderful rouladen gravy.</p>
<h2 id=why-thanksgiving-is-the-best-holiday>Why Thanksgiving is the best holiday?</h2>
<p>Thanksgiving has all the elements of the perfect holiday — you get to eat delicious food, spend time with family and friends, and you don’t even have to leave the house (if your family is hosting, that is). No matter how you celebrate, Thanksgiving is the perfect way to kick off the holiday season.</p>
<h2 id=why-do-we-eat-early-on-thanksgiving>Why do we eat early on Thanksgiving?</h2>
<p>Sitting down for an earlier dinner allows for guests to arrive earlier, sit down for the meal without a long intermission between arrival and dinner, and allow time for the feast to settle in their system before making their way back home. It also allots a lot of time and people for dish duty shifts.</p>
<h2 id=when-is-the-best-time-to-travel-to-europe-for-thanksgiving>When is the best time to travel to Europe for Thanksgiving?</h2>
<p>The great thing about traveling in Europe in late November is that it’s during the low season. Which means most tourists have left and the locals are back at work. This time of year is perfect to have family and friends from the U.S. fly over to explore with you. Consider visiting these places during your Thanksgiving holiday:</p>
<h2 id=when-does-thanksgiving-take-place-in-german-speaking-countries>When does Thanksgiving take place in German speaking countries?</h2>
<p>Thanksgiving in Germany. In the German-speaking countries Thanksgiving is an autumn harvest celebration called Erntedank or Erntedankfest (“harvest thanksgiving festival”). The observance usually takes place in September or October. Similar harvest festivals are common in many countries and regions around the globe.</p>
<h2 id=is-the-holiday-of-erntedank-the-same-as-thanksgiving>Is the holiday of Erntedank the same as Thanksgiving?</h2>
<p>As you can tell from the above, the European thanksgiving observance is not anything like the more secular traditional family holiday and feast in Canada and the United States. Unless they live in a rural area or are church-goers, most Germans have only experienced Erntedankfest by seeing it on television.</p>
<h2 id=when-do-we-start-celebrating-thanksgiving-in-canada>When do we start celebrating Thanksgiving in Canada?</h2>
<p>This puts the Germanic thanksgiving closer to Canada’s Thanksgiving holiday in early October, rather than the American observance in late November, but there is no official date or any nationwide observance as in the US and Canada.</p>
