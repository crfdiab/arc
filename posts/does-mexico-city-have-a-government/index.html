<h2 id=does-mexico-city-have-a-government>Does Mexico City have a government?</h2>
<p>The federal government, known as the Supreme Power of the Federation, is constituted by the Powers of the Union: the legislative, the executive, and the judicial. Mexico City, as the capital of Mexico, seats all the powers of the Union.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-fundamental-principle-of-democracy>What is fundamental principle of democracy?</h2>
<p>The fundamental principle of the democracy upon which the democracy is founded is the political equality which provides for the participation of all people in the democratic process without any discrimination as to gender, race, caste, colour etc.</p>
<h2 id=what-makes-a-democracy-a-democracy-in-mexico>What makes a democracy a democracy in Mexico?</h2>
<p>Mexico Democracy. Democracy requires several elements to succeed and grow. The leaders of a democracy must respect the boundaries they are given. Freedom of the press is an essential element of modern democracy. People must be willing to participate and support the system of government.</p>
<h2 id=what-kind-of-government-do-they-have-in-mexico>What kind of government do they have in Mexico?</h2>
<p>Administration Of Mexico. Mexico is governed through a Federal District, which are Mexico City and its immediate regions and 31 states. Each state is governed by its constitution and retains legislative rights and the right to levy taxes excluding interstate customs duties. States are headed by a governor elected for a six-year term.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-the-pri-affect-democracy-in-mexico>How did the PRI affect democracy in Mexico?</h2>
<p>Included in the injustices promoted by the PRI through manipulation of the voting system, the party also dominated Mexico’s politics on both the national and state levels. Thus, this militarized rule prevented the authentic practice of democracy by often nullifying what should have been the effective powers of the electorate. [2]</p>
<h2 id=how-is-the-head-of-state-elected-in-mexico>How is the head of state elected in Mexico?</h2>
<p>The president is the commander-in-chief of the armed forces and also the head of state. The President of Mexico is elected by an absolute majority of the 31 states and the federal districts. Mexico’s president is elected for six years and cannot be re-elected.</p>
