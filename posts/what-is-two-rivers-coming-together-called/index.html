<h2 id=what-is-two-rivers-coming-together-called>What is two rivers coming together called?</h2>
<p>A confluence occurs when two or more flowing bodies of water join together to form a single channel. Confluences occur where a tributary joins a larger river, where two rivers join to create a third or, where two separated channels of a river, having formed an island, rejoin downstream. That is a confluence!</p>
<h2 id=what-is-a-river-that-joins-another-river-called>What is a river that joins another river called?</h2>
<p>A tributary is a freshwater stream that feeds into a larger stream or river. The larger, or parent, river is called the mainstem. The point where a tributary meets the mainstem is called the confluence. Tributaries, also called affluents, do not flow directly into the ocean.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-it-called-when-3-rivers-meet>What is it called when 3 rivers meet?</h2>
<p>“Confluence” is the word used to denote the place where two or more water bodies meet, may be it that a tributary meets the main riveror two rivers meet to form a new river, or three or four rivers meet at a point.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-it-called-when-two-rivers-join>What is it called when two rivers join?</h2>
<p>Answer Wiki. 1 Answer. In geography, a confluence is the meeting of two or more bodies of water. Also known as a conflux, it refers either to the point where a tributary joins a larger river, called the main stem, or where two streams meet to become the source of a river of a new name.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-a-small-river-that-flows-into-a-larger-river-called>What is a small river that flows into a larger river called?</h2>
<p>A small river that flows into a large river is called a tributary. The tributary meets the parent river, named the mainstem, at a point called the confluence.</p>
<h2 id=what-do-you-call-the-transition-between-river-and-ocean>What do you call the transition between River and Ocean?</h2>
<p>The transition between river and ocean, bay or lake is known as a delta. Most rivers have a delta, an area where the river divides into many channels and river water mixes with sea or lake water as the river water reaches the end of its journey.</p>
