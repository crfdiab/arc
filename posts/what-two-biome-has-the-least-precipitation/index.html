<p>“Tundra and desert” are the two biomes among the choices given in the question that have the least precipitation.</p>
<h2 id=what-biome-receives-the-least-amount-of-precipitation>What biome receives the least amount of precipitation?</h2>
<p>The Tundra and Desert receive the least amount of precipitation.</p>

<table><tr><th>A</th><th>B</th></tr><tr><td>Which biome is characterized by very low temperatures, little precipitation, and permafrost?</td><td>Tundra,</td></tr><tr><td>Which two biomes have the least amount of precipitation?</td><td>Desert and tundra</td></tr><tr><td>A biome is identified by its particular set of abiotic factors and its \_\_\_.</td><td>characteristic plant and animal communities</td></tr></table>
<h2 id=what-biomes-receives-the-most-precipitation>What biomes receives the most precipitation?</h2>
<p>Rainforests receive the most rain of all of the biomes in a year! A typical year sees 2,000 to 10,000 millimeters (79 to 394 inches) of rain per year.</p>
<h2 id=which-is-two-biomes-have-the-least-amount-of-precipitation>Which is two biomes have the least amount of precipitation?</h2>
<p>The tundra and desert biomes receive the least amount of rainfall. The annual rainfall total of a tundra averages between 10 to 25 cm each year, while the desert receives fewer than 25 cm per year.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-the-different-types-of-terrestrial-biomes>What are the different types of terrestrial biomes?</h2>
<p>There are eight major terrestrial biomes: tropical rainforests, savannas, subtropical deserts, chaparral, temperate grasslands, temperate forests, boreal forests, and Arctic tundra. Biomes are large-scale environments that are distinguished by characteristic temperature ranges and amounts of precipitation.</p>
<h2 id=which-is-biome-is-characterized-by-thin-nutrient-poor-soils>Which is biome is characterized by thin nutrient poor soils?</h2>
<p>Desert biomes vary greatly in temperature but are always defined as having less than _____ cm of rainfall per year., Which type of biome is characterized by thin, nutrient-poor soils?</p>
<h2 id=what-kind-of-rainfall-does-a-subtropical-desert-get>What kind of rainfall does a subtropical desert get?</h2>
<p>Subtropical deserts are characterized by low annual precipitation of fewer than 30 cm (12 in) with little monthly variation and lack of predictability in rainfall. Some years may receive tiny amounts of rainfall, while others receive more.</p>
