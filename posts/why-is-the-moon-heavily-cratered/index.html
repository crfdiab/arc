<h2 id=why-is-the-moon-heavily-cratered>Why is the Moon heavily cratered?</h2>
<p>Why does the Moon have so many craters while Earth has so few? On Earth, impact craters are harder to recognize because of weathering and erosion of its surface. The Moon lacks water, an atmosphere, and tectonic activity, three forces that erode Earth’s surface and erase all but the most recent impacts.</p>
<h2 id=why-is-the-moons-surface-much-more-heavily-cratered-than-earths-surface>Why is the Moon’s surface much more heavily cratered than Earth’s surface?</h2>
<p>The moon’s surface is much more heavily cratered than Earth’s surface because ancient craters have already disappeared on Earth . They were worn away over time by water , wind , and other forces . Since the moon has no liquid water or atmosphere , its surface has changed very little .</p>
<h2 id=why-is-the-moon-scarred>Why is the Moon scarred?</h2>
<p>The Earth’s gravity is stronger than the moon’s, so it attracts more space debris than the moon does. Unlike the Earth, the moon does not have processes that remove craters from its surface. Earth has weather, water, and plants. These act together to break apart and wear down the ground.</p>
<h2 id=is-the-crater-on-the-moon-natural-or-manmade>Is the crater on the Moon natural or manmade?</h2>
<p>A crater is a depression found on the surface of a planet or a moon. Craters can be either natural or manmade. When people use the word “crater,” they are generally referring to impact craters.</p>
<h2 id=why-are-there-fewer-impact-craters-on-the-moon-than-on-the-earth>Why are there fewer impact craters on the Moon than on the Earth?</h2>
<p>The moon may attract fewer bits of space rock than the Earth, but the moon is powerless to do anything about it after it has been hit. Once something hits the moon, that event becomes frozen in time. Earth, on the other hand, simply brushes these impact craters off and moves on with its life.</p>
<h2 id=what-kind-of-rock-causes-an-impact-crater>What kind of rock causes an impact crater?</h2>
<p>Because impact craters are usually caused by meteorites, they are often called “meteorite craters.” Impact craters generally have a roughly circular outline and a raised rim. The size of an impact crater can range anywhere from a small, simple, shallow depression in the ground to an extremely large, multi-ringed basin.</p>
<h2 id=which-is-the-first-crater-on-the-earth>Which is the first crater on the Earth?</h2>
<p>Earth: Meteor Crater. Meteor Crater (also known as Barringer Crater) in Arizona was the first crater discovered to be formed by an extraterrestrial impact. It formed 50,000 years ago from a meteorite that may have been up to about 150 feet wide traveling more than 28,000 mph.</p>
