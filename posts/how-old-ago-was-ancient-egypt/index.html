<h2 id=how-old-ago-was-ancient-egypt>How old ago was ancient Egypt?</h2>
<p>Around 5000 years ago<br>
Around 5000 years ago the ancient Egyptians established an extraordinary and enduring civilisation.</p>
<h2 id=when-did-ancient-egypt-begin>When did ancient Egypt begin?</h2>
<p>approximately 3100 BCE<br>
The dynastic period started with the reign of Egypt’s first king, Narmer, in approximately 3100 BCE, and ended with the death of Cleopatra VII in 30 BCE. During this long period there were times of strong centalised rule, and periods of much weaker, divided rule, but basically Egypt remained one, independent land.</p>
<h2 id=is-egypt-9000-years-old>Is Egypt 9000 years old?</h2>
<p>The Qadan culture (13,000–9,000 BC) was a Mesolithic industry that, archaeological evidence suggests, originated in Upper Egypt (present-day south Egypt) approximately 15,000 years ago. The Qadan subsistence mode is estimated to have persisted for approximately 4,000 years.</p>
<h2 id=how-long-has-egypt-been-a-country>How long has Egypt been a country?</h2>
<p>The modern Republic of Egypt was founded in 1953, and with the complete withdrawal of British forces from the Suez Canal in 1956, it marked the first time in 2500 years that Egypt was both fully independent and ruled by native Egyptians.</p>
<h2 id=how-old-was-ancient-egypt-in-the-bible>How old was ancient Egypt in the Bible?</h2>
<p>In biblical times, Egypt was already an ancient civilization and the pyramids were thousands of years old.</p>
<h2 id=when-did-the-civilization-of-ancient-egypt-start>When did the civilization of ancient Egypt start?</h2>
<p>The civilization coalesced around 3150 BC (according to conventional Egyptian chronology) with the political unification of Upper and Lower Egypt under the first pharaoh. But this would not have been possible had there not already been settlers around the Nile valley in early 3500 BC.</p>

<h2 id=are-there-any-written-accounts-of-ancient-egypt>Are there any written accounts of ancient Egypt?</h2>
<p>His accounts of ancient Egyptian history were preserved by ancient Greek writers and, until the deciphering of hieroglyphic writing in the 19 th century, were one of the few historical accounts that scholars could read. Modern-day scholars often group these dynasties into several periods.</p>
