<p>When, in 1973, Tanzania decided to shift its capital city from Dar es Salaam to Dodoma, it was envisaged that the move would take 10 years, and that the cost could be justified when set against a long-term perspective.</p>
<h2 id=why-does-tanzania-have-two-capitals>Why does Tanzania have two capitals?</h2>
<p>Tanzania has two capitals, as efforts to move its government have been unsuccessful. Dar es Salaam was chosen as the capital of the Republic of Tanzania after the country was founded in 1961. For this reason, it was decided to move the capital to the more central city of Dodoma. However, that move has been slow.</p>

<h2 id=why-was-dar-es-salaam-chosen-as-the-capital-of-tanzania>Why was Dar es Salaam chosen as the capital of Tanzania?</h2>
<p>This move was made in an effort to make social and economic improvements to the central region of the country, and to better centralize the capital. Today, Dar es Salaam remains the largest city in Tanzania, with a population of about 4.2 million people.</p>

<p>Tanzania’s cities are among the fastest developing cities in Africa. Dodoma is one of the developing cities.
