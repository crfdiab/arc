<p>A. 17 August 1849 was the date when they finalized construction of railway in India. It was based on “guarantee system” in which they were provided free land in return of 5% rate of return to private British companies. The name given to the railway was “the Great Indian Peninsular Railway”.</p>
<h2 id=when-did-the-great-indian-peninsular-railway-start>When did the Great Indian Peninsular Railway start?</h2>
<p>On 8 May 1845, Madras Railway was incorporated, and East India Railway (EIR) was incorporated the same year. On 1 August 1849 Great Indian Peninsular Railway (GIPR) was incorporated by an Act of Parliament.</p>
<h2 id=when-was-the-first-locomotive-used-in-india>When was the first locomotive used in India?</h2>
<p>They may well add “The same railway at Rurki was the first time a locomotive was used in India, 21st December 1851”. However, the use of rail transport in India can be traced back a decade and half before this with two known systems being used. In addition to this, the first use of a locomotive in India was also some 15 years earlier.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-guarantee-system-for-indian-railways>What was the guarantee system for Indian Railways?</h2>
<p>These supporters prevailed upon the British Parliament to create the Guarantee System, whereby any company that constructed railways in India was guaranteed a certain rate of interest on its capital investment. This guarantee was honoured by the East India Company which then controlled large parts of India.</p>
