<p>“At first I couldn’t even be grateful I had survived the accident, because I was so upset,” she told The Guardian in a 2012 interview. “But it gave me more confidence in the end, because I thought, ‘OK, I have a scar, but maybe I have something more to me than the way I look.</p>

<p>Although the line of succession can continue to be traced, none of the Stuarts’ subsequent heirs ever claimed the British throne, or the crowns of England, Scotland or Ireland.</p>
<h2 id=who-was-the-first-person-to-cross-the-atlantic-from-east-to-west>Who was the first person to cross the Atlantic from east to West?</h2>
<p>In 1952, Alain Bombard crossed the Atlantic from East to West, journeying 113 days in a Zodiac, L’Hérétique. In 1956, Henri Beaudout crossed the Atlantic from West to East, from Halifax to Falmouth, on a raft of wood and rope, L’Égaré II, in 88 days.</p>

<p>DUSAN MARTINCEK Masterpiece PBS’s new series Atlantic Crossing may be a World War II story, but it’s unlike most programs about the conflict. The period drama tells the story of Crown Princess Martha of Norway, her relationship with American President FDR, and how she used her friendship to help her country in crisis.</p>
<h2 id=who-was-the-king-of-england-during-the-jacobite-succession>Who was the King of England during the Jacobite succession?</h2>
<p>The Jacobite succession is the line through which the crown in pretence of England, Scotland and Ireland (France also claimed) has descended since the flight of James II & VII from London at the time of the “Glorious Revolution”. James and his Jacobite successors were traditionally toasted as “The King over the Water”.</p>
