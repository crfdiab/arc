<h2 id=what-kind-of-fossil-is-a-fish>What kind of fossil is a fish?</h2>
<p>Introduction & History of Fossil Fish. Most of the vertebrate remains that have been found in the late Pennsylvanian and early Permian strata of southeastern Nebraska are elasmobranchs, a group of fishes that includes sharks, rays, chimaeroids, sawfish, and guitar fish. These fishes have wholly cartilaginous skeletons.</p>
<h2 id=can-fish-turn-into-fossils>Can fish turn into fossils?</h2>
<p>Fish fossils become buried treasure: Fossilized fish could indicate rich deposits of valuable rare-earth metals — ScienceDaily.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-an-example-of-a-cast-fossil>What is an example of a cast fossil?</h2>
<p>An example of a cast fossil is a cast of a plant leaf or trilobite.</p>
<h2 id=how-does-a-fossil-of-a-fish-form>How does a fossil of a fish form?</h2>
<p>Fossils are formed in different ways, but most are formed when a plant or animal dies in a watery environment and is buried in mud and silt. Soft tissues quickly decompose leaving the hard bones or shells behind. Over time sediment builds over the top and hardens into rock.</p>
<h2 id=how-do-you-tell-if-youve-found-a-fossil>How do you tell if you’ve found a fossil?</h2>
<p>If they are smooth and do not have any real texture, they are probably rocks. Even if it is shaped like a bone, if it does not have the right texture then it is probably a rock. Lastly, paleontologists do a final inspection of their possible fossil by checking for pores.</p>

<h2 id=what-is-the-difference-between-a-mold-and-cast-fossil>What is the difference between a mold and cast fossil?</h2>
<p>Sometimes when an animal dies and its body decays, it can leave an imprint in the sediment. If this imprint fills in with minerals from sediment and groundwater, it can harden to form a fossil. This fossil is called a cast fossil. The fossilized imprint is called a mold fossil.</p>
<h2 id=is-it-possible-to-determine-the-age-of-a-fossil>Is it possible to determine the age of a fossil?</h2>
<p>To establish the age of a rock or a fossil, researchers use some type of clock to determine the date it was formed. Geologists commonly use radiometric dating methods, based on the natural radioactive decay of certain elements such as potassium and carbon, as reliable clocks to date ancient events.</p>
<h2 id=what-rocks-are-likely-to-contain-fossils>What rocks are likely to contain fossils?</h2>
<p>There are three main types of rock: igneous rock, metamorphic rock, and sedimentary rock. Almost all fossils are preserved in sedimentary rock.</p>
<h2 id=how-are-fossils-formed-from-molds-and-casts>How are fossils formed from molds and casts?</h2>
<p>Fossils also form from molds and casts. If an organism completely dissolves in sedimentary rock, it can leave an impression of its exterior in the rock, called an external mold.</p>
<p>There is an evolutionist’s book that explains how fish fossils form. There’s a picture of a fish in a pond, then the fish dies, and then it sinks to the bottom. Slowly over long periods of time it’s covered by mud, and then turns into a fish fossil.</p>
<h2 id=when-does-an-animal-or-plant-become-a-fossil>When does an animal or plant become a fossil?</h2>
<p>A fossil can only form if an animal or plant is buried soon after death, before it rots away or is eaten. For example, many fossilized animals died in rivers and quickly sank into the mud on the bottom.</p>
<h2 id=are-there-any-fossils-that-show-no-rotting>Are there any fossils that show no rotting?</h2>
<p>If fact, many of them indicate the fish hadn’t rotted at all. Fossils which show no rotting are very, very rare. AiG- Actually, if you’ve observed what happens when a fish dies in an aquarium, it doesn’t sink, it floats. And then, when it starts to sink, it’s rotting and falling apart. This assumes that dead fish float until they rot.</p>
