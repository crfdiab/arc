<h2 id=where-did-they-grow-pineapples-in-the-uk>Where did they grow pineapples in the UK?</h2>
<p>Pineapples were grown in Barbados, then the richest British colony, and there were many reports by travellers of seeing them grow. There are also stories of the fruit rotting en route to London, so to see them was special. It was another thing to get them to flourish in Britain.</p>
