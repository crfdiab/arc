<h2 id=what-was-the-purpose-of-tenochtitlan>What was the purpose of Tenochtitlan?</h2>
<p>Tenochtitlan (also spelled Tenochtitlán), located on an island near the western shore of Lake Texcoco in central Mexico, was the capital city and religious centre of the Aztec civilization.</p>
<h2 id=when-was-tenochtitlan-built>When was Tenochtitlan built?</h2>
<p>June 20, 1325<br>
Tenochtitlan/Founded</p>
<h2 id=what-is-tenochtitlan-and-how-did-it-fall>What is Tenochtitlan and how did it fall?</h2>
<p>The Fall of Tenochtitlan, the capital of the Aztec Empire, was a decisive event in the Spanish conquest of the empire. It occurred in 1521 following extensive manipulation of local factions and exploitation of pre-existing political divisions by Spanish conquistador Hernán Cortés.</p>
<h2 id=why-is-the-teotihuacan-important>Why is the Teotihuacan important?</h2>
<p>The Teotihuacan Valley’s importance to the Aztec empire was proven when it became the first of the core provinces to secede from the empire, siding against Montezuma in a nasty civil war about five years before Cortés reached Tenochtitlan/Mexico City.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-unique-about-tenochtitlan>What is unique about Tenochtitlan?</h2>
<p>The small natural island was perpetually enlarged as an artificial island as Tenochtitlan grew to become the largest and most powerful city in Mesoamerica. Commercial routes were developed that brought goods from places as far as the Gulf of Mexico, the Pacific Ocean and perhaps even the Inca Empire.</p>
<h2 id=who-was-responsible-for-the-fall-of-tenochtitlan>Who was responsible for the fall of Tenochtitlan?</h2>
<p>After a three-month siege, Spanish forces under Hernán Cortés capture Tenochtitlán, the capital of the Aztec empire. Cortés’ men leveled the city and captured Cuauhtémoc, the Aztec emperor.</p>
<h2 id=who-built-the-city-of-tenochtitlan>Who built the city of Tenochtitlan?</h2>
<p>Tenochtitlan was the capitol city built by the Aztecs in the middle of Lake Texcoco. They migrated to and settled in the Valley of Mexico. They believed they were the chosen people and led to the area by the god Huitzilopochtli.</p>

<h2 id=where-are-the-ruins-of-tenochtitlan-in-mexico>Where are the ruins of Tenochtitlan in Mexico?</h2>
<p>Most of the Tenochtitlan’s buildings were destroyed by the Spanish and Hernan Cortes. The current capital of Mexico, Mexico City, is located at the same location. Archeologists have uncovered the ruins of Tenochtitlan near the center of Mexico City.</p>
<h2 id=how-many-people-lived-in-the-city-of-tenochtitlan>How many people lived in the city of Tenochtitlan?</h2>
<p>Some historians estimate that nearly 200,000 people lived in the city during its peak. Is it still there today? Most of the Tenochtitlan’s buildings were destroyed by the Spanish and Hernan Cortes. The current capital of Mexico, Mexico City, is located at the same location.</p>
