<h2 id=why-is-the-uk-warmer-in-summer>Why is the UK warmer in summer?</h2>
<p>The western side of Britain is warmed by the influence of the tropical maritime airstream. Temperatures are therefore colder in the east than in the west during winter. During summer the south is warmer than the north. This is due to the differences in solar heat received, being greater in the south.</p>
<h2 id=why-is-the-uk-getting-wetter>Why is the UK getting wetter?</h2>
<p>As the earth warms up, the air is able to retain a greater amount of water vapour. The United Kingdom has witnessed a rise of about 0.7C in the temperature in the last four decades. This would increase the moisture retaining capacity of air by almost 4%, in turn, leading to wetter weather conditions.</p>
<h2 id=are-british-summers-getting-wetter>Are British summers getting wetter?</h2>
<p>The UK is already seeing increasingly extreme weather, with 2020 the third warmest, fifth wettest and eighth sunniest year on record – the first ever to fall into the top 10 for all three variables.</p>
<h2 id=why-has-it-been-raining-so-much-in-the-uk>Why has it been raining so much in the UK?</h2>
<p>Why is the weather so miserable at the moment? Lots of low pressure has swept across the UK bringing heavy and persistent rain to a lot of areas. A spokesperson said: “The UK does get very variable weather so it’s not unusual to get more unsettled periods of weather, even sometimes in the summer months.”</p>
<h2 id=is-britain-getting-wetter>Is Britain getting wetter?</h2>
<p>The most recent decade (2011-2020) has been on average 0.5 degrees Celsius warmer than the 1981-2010 average and 1.1C warmer than 1961-1990. Britain has also been on average 6% wetter over the last 30 years (1991-2020) than the preceding 30 years (1961-1990).</p>
<h2 id=what-is-extreme-rain>What is extreme rain?</h2>
<p>Extreme precipitation events are defined as days with precipitation in the top 1 percent of all days with precipitation. Increases in the intensity or frequency of heavy precipitation are key factors that affect the risk of floods and flash floods.</p>
<h2 id=are-uk-winters-getting-wetter>Are UK winters getting wetter?</h2>
<p>Warmer wetter winters Rainfall is expected to increase in many parts of the country in winter too, the Met Office says. The projections suggest western parts of the UK may get even wetter under a high-emissions scenario.</p>
<h2 id=why-is-it-so-hot-in-the-uk-2020>Why is it so hot in the UK 2020?</h2>
<p>Much of the UK’s hot weather comes from the jet stream, which is a narrow band of high speed winds. The warm air that’s being brought up to us is originating in northern Africa, and this week the winds will change and bring it through Europe and up to us from France, meaning the air we’re getting is exceptionally hot.</p>
<h2 id=is-england-a-boring-country>Is England a boring country?</h2>
<p>A new survey has ranked the UK as the best country, despite it’s people being the ‘most boring’. More than a quarter of a million people from 35 countries said the UK is top when it comes to culture, people and tourism potential.</p>
<h2 id=is-the-weather-in-the-uk-getting-wetter>Is the weather in the UK getting wetter?</h2>
<p>Our weather is also getting wetter, with 17% more extremely wet days between 2008 and 2017 compared to 1961 to 1990. Dr McCarthy said: “Monthly, seasonal and annual climate data provide a valuable record of the changing climate in the UK. “However, these average figures have a tendency to mask extreme weather and climate events.”</p>
<h2 id=is-the-uk-getting-hotter-in-the-summer>Is the UK Getting Hotter in the summer?</h2>
<p>‘The UK is projected to become hotter and drier in summer, and warmer and wetter in winter’, agency says</p>
<h2 id=are-there-going-to-be-drier-summers-in-uk>Are there going to be drier summers in UK?</h2>
<p>In a speech at the Science Museum in London, Mr Gove will say that the UK could face drier summers and wetter winters and the survival of the planet can only be safeguarded if scientific warnings are heeded more keenly. “It is clear that the planet and its weather patterns are changing before our eyes,” he will say.</p>
<h2 id=is-the-weather-in-the-south-east-getting-wetter>Is the weather in the south east getting wetter?</h2>
<p>Between 2008 and last year, a number of tropical nights were seen in the South East, the Midlands and South Wales. Our weather is also getting wetter, with 17% more extremely wet days between 2008 and 2017 compared to 1961 to 1990.</p>
