<p>Sims, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that, unlike the United States Senate, state senates must be elected from districts of approximately equal population . In 40 of the 49 bicameral state legislatures, the lower house is called the “House of Representatives”.</p>
<h2 id=what-kind-of-government-does-each-state-have>What kind of government does each state have?</h2>
