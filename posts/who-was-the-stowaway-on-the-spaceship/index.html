<h2 id=who-was-the-stowaway-on-the-spaceship>Who was the stowaway on the spaceship?</h2>
<p>Shamier Anderson<br>
In May, Shamier Anderson was cast as the titular stowaway, and Daniel Dae Kim joined as the ship’s biologist. Filming began on June 11, 2019 in Cologne and Munich and wrapped after 30 days.</p>
<h2 id=is-stowaway-a-true-story>Is Stowaway a true story?</h2>
<p>Stowaway is not based on a true story, but it is based on a short film from 1954 called The Cold Equations, which was written by Tom Godwin. In The Cold Equations science was used to punish a female trespasser on a spacecraft and both The Cold Equations and Stowaway hold many similarities.</p>
<h2 id=how-does-michael-get-stuck-in-stowaway>How does Michael get stuck in Stowaway?</h2>
<p>In Stowaway, Michael explains how he got on board at the 25-minute mark. He states that he’s a launch support engineer for Hyperion and that he must’ve been knocked unconscious while arming the second stage firing pin.</p>
<h2 id=does-zoe-die-in-stowaway>Does Zoe die in Stowaway?</h2>
<p>Sadly, yes. Zoe dies, even though we don’t see it on screen. In the lead-up, the time pressure is on as the crew must capture the second oxygen tank from the launch vehicle before it leaks out.</p>
<h2 id=does-michael-die-on-stowaway>Does Michael die on Stowaway?</h2>
<p>Michael nearly dies after being discovered in the Netflix Original movie – per Zoe’s remarks about his injuries – and he seems entirely confused about his whereabouts, presumably because of a concussion (also noted by Zoe).</p>
<h2 id=does-michael-kill-himself-in-stowaway>Does Michael kill himself in Stowaway?</h2>
<p>How does Stowaway end? After Daniel Dae Kim tries to convince Michael to kill himself (triple yikes!!!), he and Anna Kendrick decide to try to retrieve the extra oxygen that is hovering above the ship. But Kendrick slips and falls, and loses the tank.</p>
<h2 id=how-old-was-stowaway-to-the-moon-movie>How old was Stowaway to the Moon movie?</h2>
<p>Stowaway to the Moon (1975) 1h 40min | Family, Sci-Fi | TV Movie 10 January 1975. An 11 year old boy, who has always been fascinated by space and astronauts, wishes he could go into space also. So of course it should be easy to get into Cape Kennedy, up the launch tower,…</p>
<h2 id=why-are-there-so-many-stowaway-creatures-on-the-moon>Why are there so many stowaway creatures on the Moon?</h2>
<p>This isn’t mandated by international law, but most space-faring nations adhere to this policy of planetary protection under guidelines established by an international group known as the Committee on Space Research. Those guidelines dictate how much biological material you can send into space based on where you’re going.</p>
<h2 id=how-old-was-stowaway-when-he-went-into-space>How old was stowaway when he went into space?</h2>
<p>An 11 year old boy, who has always been fascinated by space and astronauts, wishes he could go into space also. So of course it should be easy to get into Cape Kennedy, up the launch tower, and into the capsule. Naturally when something goes wrong on the journey, he will save the day.</p>
<h2 id=how-old-was-michael-link-in-stowaway-to-the-moon>How old was Michael link in Stowaway to the Moon?</h2>
<p>The made-for-TV Stowaway to the Moon may be regarded by some as an excellent argument for birth control. Michael Link plays E.J., an 11-year-old boy fascinated by manned space travel. While visiting Cape Canaveral, E. J. accidentally finds himself on board a space missile. By and by, he is accidentally launched to the moon.</p>
