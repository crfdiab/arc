<h2 id=why-is-farming-important-in-brazil>Why is farming important in Brazil?</h2>
<p>The agriculture of Brazil is historically one of the principal bases of Brazil’s economy. While its initial focus was on sugarcane, Brazil eventually became the world’s largest exporter of coffee, soybeans, beef, and crop-based ethanol. This region produces most of Brazil’s grains, oilseeds (and exports).</p>
<h2 id=what-is-brazils-most-important-crop>What is Brazil’s most important crop?</h2>
<p>Major crops are soybean, maize, sugarcane, and rice which account for 90% of total crop area, and (except for rice) the country is one of the largest producers and exporters of these crops.</p>
<h2 id=what-type-of-agriculture-is-used-in-brazil>What type of agriculture is used in Brazil?</h2>
<p>Major agricultural products are coffee, sugar, soybeans, manioc, rice, maize, cotton, edible beans and wheat. Brazil produces about 20 billion litres of milk per annum and is the sixth or seventh largest world producer.</p>
<h2 id=why-is-family-farming-so-important-in-brazil>Why is family farming so important in Brazil?</h2>
<p>In Brazil, family farming is an important part of food production: 87% of cassava production; 70% of beans; 46% of corn; 38% of coffee; 34% of rice; 58% of milk; 59% of pigs; and 50% of birds, are due to family farming according to data of the Agricultural Census 2006 / IBGE.</p>
<h2 id=what-kind-of-crops-do-they-grow-in-brazil>What kind of crops do they grow in Brazil?</h2>
<p>Today, a number of crops are grown here. Cattle farming remains one of this country’s key industries, since Brazil produces millions of tonnes of beef every year. Cattle farming occurs mainly in Mato Grosso, Mato Grosso do Sul, Goiás and Minas Gerais. Significantly, Brazil is also the second-largest producer of soybeans on the planet.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-the-challenges-of-agriculture-in-brazil>What are the challenges of Agriculture in Brazil?</h2>
<p>Agriculture in Brazil presents challenges, including the ongoing practice of slave labour, agrarian reform, fire, production financing, and a rural exodus fueled by economic stress on family farming.</p>
