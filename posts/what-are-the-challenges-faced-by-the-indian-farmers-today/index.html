<h2 id=what-are-the-major-problems-faced-by-farmers-in-india>What are the major problems faced by farmers in India?</h2>
<p>Major Problems faced by farmers in India are as follows. Seeds are the basic input or raw material for the farmers to grow crops. But there is a lack of availability of the good quality of seeds in the market. And if the good quality seeds are available, they are so expensive that the poor and marginal farmers are not able to afford.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-the-challenges-of-being-a-small-farmer>What are the challenges of being a small farmer?</h2>
<p>Farmers need to have information sources to better understand regional or global trends in their specialties. They need to stay up-to-date with the latest training and production techniques. Farmers must have a keen vision of their customers, what they need and how to communicate with them.</p>
<h2 id=why-is-there-decline-in-farm-income-in-india>Why is there decline in farm income in India?</h2>
<p>At the same time alternative jobs in the non-farm sector, value addition and diversification in Agri sectors will help in increasing income of rural India. The third main cause for the decline in farm income is fragmentation of land holdings among farmers.</p>
<h2 id=why-is-farming-in-india-a-back-breaking-job>Why is farming in India a back breaking job?</h2>
<p>For all the bucolic if not romanticised portrayals of farming and a rural lifestyle, it is really a thankless, risky, and even back-breaking job, especially as undertaken by the masses, which is subsistence agriculture . One bad yield, whether due to errant rains, pests, etc., and most farmers have no buffer available.</p>
