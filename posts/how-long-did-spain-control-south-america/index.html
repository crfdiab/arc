<p>From 1492 to the 1800s, Spanish explorers were the bullies of the New World. Beginning with Columbus in 1492 and continuing for nearly 350 years, Spain conquered and settled most of South America, the Caribbean, and the American Southwest.</p>
<h2 id=does-spain-still-have-influence-in-south-america>Does Spain still have influence in South America?</h2>

<h2 id=what-are-the-lasting-effects-of-spanish-conquest>What are the lasting effects of Spanish conquest?</h2>
<p>Lasting effects of Spanish conquest in Latin America included the decimation of native populations and suppression of their languages, histories and cultures. Those who survived were strongly influenced by Spanish language, religion, art and architecture. One…</p>
<h2 id=when-did-the-spanish-give-up-their-colonies-in-the-americas>When did the Spanish give up their colonies in the Americas?</h2>
<p>In the early 19th century, the Spanish American wars of independence resulted in the secession and subsequent balkanization of most Spanish colonies in the Americas, except for Cuba and Puerto Rico, which were finally given up in 1898, following the Spanish–American War, together with Guam and the Philippines in the Pacific.</p>
