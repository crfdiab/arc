<h2 id=what-impacts-do-human-have-on-mountain>What impacts do human have on mountain?</h2>
<p>Unfortunately, human activities like mining, livestock, energy production and tourism impact them. Humans have exploited the timber, mining and pasturage resources of mountain environments for millennia. These activities and others have impacted mountain ecosystems to varying degrees.</p>
<h2 id=how-do-humans-use-the-rockies>How do humans use the Rockies?</h2>
<p>The people living in these areas have looked to water-storage projects in the Rockies for irrigation, domestic and industrial use, navigation, and hydroelectric power generation, as well as for flood control.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-some-threats-to-the-rocky-mountains>What are some threats to the Rocky Mountains?</h2>
<p>Using U.S. Forest Service data, they found three major stressors on Rocky Mountain forests: heat and drought, insects, and wildfires. Driving each of these problems, they say, is human-caused global warming.</p>
<h2 id=is-there-forest-in-the-rocky-mountains>Is there forest in the Rocky Mountains?</h2>
<p>The Colorado Rockies forests is a temperate coniferous forest ecoregion of the United States….</p>
<table><tr><th>Colorado Rockies forests</th></tr><tr><td>Biome</td><td>Temperate coniferous forest</td></tr><tr><td>Borders</td><td>Colorado Plateau shrublands, Northern short grasslands, Western short grasslands and Wyoming Basin shrub steppe</td></tr><tr><td>Bird species</td><td>210</td></tr><tr><td>Mammal species</td><td>103</td></tr></table>
<h2 id=what-native-american-groups-are-associated-with-rocky-mountain-national-park>What Native American groups are associated with Rocky Mountain National Park?</h2>
<p>Ute, Arapaho, Cheyenne, Comanche and other Native tribes lived in and traveled through the land that is now Rocky Mountain National Park.</p>
<h2 id=how-are-human-activities-affecting-rocky-mountain-national-park>How are human activities affecting Rocky Mountain National Park?</h2>
<p>Although many visitors think of the park as “pristine,”humans are having a marked impact on its environment. Airborne pollutants from vehicles, factories, and agricultural activity are altering soil and water chemistry. These changes in the physical environment are in turn altering biological communities.</p>
<h2 id=how-does-human-impact-affect-yellowstone-national-park>How does human impact affect Yellowstone National Park?</h2>
<p>As Yellowstone National Park’s website states, “Carbon dioxide, nitrogen oxides, sulfur oxide, solid particles, and volatile substances are produces by vehicles and go into the air.” This emissions effect the quality of the air, but also poorly impact animals health.</p>
<h2 id=why-did-people-live-in-the-rocky-mountains>Why did people live in the Rocky Mountains?</h2>
<p>The lands on either side of the mountain front, however, experience a water deficit. The people living in these areas have looked to water-storage projects in the Rockies for irrigation, domestic and industrial use, navigation, and hydroelectric power generation, as well as for flood control.</p>
<h2 id=how-does-the-weather-in-the-rocky-mountains-affect-the-climate>How does the weather in the Rocky Mountains affect the climate?</h2>
<p>Once moisture has been released in the mountains, the winds are drier as they move down the eastern slopes and warm rapidly to temperatures higher than the winds that came off the Pacific Ocean originally, as much as 50 degrees Fahrenheit warmer than the air they displace as they travel across the land.</p>
