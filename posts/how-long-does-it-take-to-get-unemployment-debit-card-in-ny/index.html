<h2 id=how-long-does-it-take-to-get-unemployment-debit-card-in-ny>How long does it take to get unemployment debit card in NY?</h2>
<p>If you are eligible for unemployment benefits, you should receive your debit card by mail within 7-10 business days of applying or after you request to be switched to the card. The card is issued directly from KeyBank to the address on record at the time of the request.</p>
<h2 id=can-i-track-my-unemployment-card-nyc>Can I track my unemployment card NYC?</h2>
<p>Your state’s unemployment website will inform you of when you can expect to receive your debit card. This can take a few weeks after you file your claim, so it’s a good idea to be careful with your budget until your card arrives. States typically use standard mail to send your card, so no tracking is available.</p>
<h2 id=how-do-i-speak-to-a-live-person-at-nys-unemployment>How do I speak to a live person at NYS unemployment?</h2>
<p>NY Unemployment customer service phone number is 1-888-209-8124. Live customer service representatives from NY Unemployment are available from 8am to 5pm EST Monday-Friday.</p>
<h2 id=what-day-of-the-week-does-ny-unemployment-pay>What day of the week does NY unemployment pay?</h2>
<p>An unemployment week runs Monday through Sunday. If you wish to claim benefits for a week of unemployment, you have from the Sunday date at the end of that week through the next Saturday to do so. The first week of your claim is a waiting period and is not paid.</p>
<h2 id=how-can-i-get-through-to-nys-unemployment>How can I get through to NYS unemployment?</h2>
<p>The answer is 888-209-8124. In a time when most people no longer memorize phone numbers, unemployed New Yorkers can quickly recite that one. What they’re looking for is an inside number, a short cut to waiting for hours on hold or being disconnected.</p>
<h2 id=how-to-apply-for-unemployment-benefits-in-new-york>How to apply for unemployment benefits in New York?</h2>
<p>To apply for benefits, you must log in to the New York Department of Labor website. You can also apply by calling the Telephone Claims Center at (888) 209-8124. New York is currently offering extended telephone filing hours: Monday–Thursday, 8:00 a.m. to 7:30 p.m</p>
<h2 id=how-to-get-a-new-debit-card-for-unemployment>How to get a new debit card for unemployment?</h2>
<p>To request a replacement card, call U.S. Bank ReliaCard® at 888-233-5916 (one card per year is available at no charge). If you have direct deposit, but prefer to receive your UC payments via debit card, you can submit a form to stop direct deposit at Direct Deposit of UC Benefits .</p>
<h2 id=where-do-i-get-my-unemployment-insurance-payments>Where do I get my unemployment insurance payments?</h2>
<p>If you do not choose to have your benefits direct deposited, you will receive your Unemployment Insurance benefits payments on a debit card. The card is mailed to you and comes with information on how to use it.</p>
<h2 id=what-to-do-if-you-are-denied-unemployment-in-new-york>What to do if you are denied unemployment in New York?</h2>
<p>You can file an appeal if you are denied benefits. If the Department of Labor determines that you are ineligible to receive benefits for one or more weeks, then you can appeal that decision within 30 days and request a hearing in front of an Administrative Law Judge. What New York unemployment requirements should I follow to receive benefits?</p>
