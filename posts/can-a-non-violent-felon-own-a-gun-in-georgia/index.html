<h2 id=can-a-non-violent-felon-own-a-gun-in-georgia>Can a non violent felon own a gun in Georgia?</h2>
<p>Georgia law prohibits people convicted of felonies from possessing firearms. Similarly, people currently on first offender probation are also not allowed to carry guns. Felons cannot have guns unless and until their rights are restored in the State of Georgia.</p>
<h2 id=what-criminal-charges-disqualify-you-from-owning-a-gun-in-georgia>What criminal charges disqualify you from owning a gun in Georgia?</h2>
<p>Federal law states that anyone who is convicted of a family violence or domestic violence crime will lose their right to own or possess a firearm. This includes misdemeanors under Georgia law as well as felony crimes. A violation of the federal firearms ban has a maximum sentence of 10 years in prison.</p>
<h2 id=how-can-a-felon-get-his-gun-rights-back-in-georgia>How can a felon get his gun rights back in Georgia?</h2>
<p>A pardon in Georgia does not fully restore the rights a felon loses when suffering a conviction (although the right to vote is immediately restored upon the completion of any felony sentence): the individual affected must apply for a restoration of civil and political rights through the State Board of Pardons and …</p>
<h2 id=what-are-the-qualifications-to-buy-a-gun-in-georgia>What are the qualifications to buy a gun in Georgia?</h2>
<p>– Georgia law requires that you be at least 18 years of age to possess either a handgun or long gun such as a rifle or shotgun. While you can legally own a handgun in Georgia at 18 years of age, Federal law requires you to be at least 21 years of age before you can purchase a handgun.</p>
<h2 id=can-a-felon-get-their-gun-rights-back-in-ga>Can a felon get their gun rights back in GA?</h2>
<p>No. The Georgia State Board of Pardons and Paroles does not have the authority to restore firearm rights on felony federal convictions. You will need to apply for a presidential pardon.</p>
<h2 id=can-a-convicted-felon-own-a-gun-in-georgia>Can a convicted felon own a gun in Georgia?</h2>
<p>No one has ever been charged with violating this ordinance. An amendment exempts those who conscientiously object to owning a firearm, convicted felons, those who cannot afford a firearm, and those with a mental or physical disability that would prevent them from owning a firearm.</p>
<h2 id=can-you-carry-a-gun-without-a-permit-in-georgia>Can you carry a gun without a permit in Georgia?</h2>
<p>There are a number of ways a firearm can be carried without a permit. No permit is needed: State preemption laws prohibit localities from regulating the ownership, transportation, and possession of firearms. Georgia also has a law preventing localities from enacting ordinances or lawsuits to classify gun ranges as nuisances.</p>
<h2 id=do-you-have-to-tell-law-enforcement-you-have-a-gun-in-georgia>Do you have to tell law enforcement you have a gun in Georgia?</h2>
<p>There is nothing in Georgia gun laws that state you must inform a law enforcement officer you have a firearm when approached on official business. The law does state that you must carry your permit at all times during which the permittee is in actual possession of a concealed handgun.</p>
<h2 id=is-it-illegal-to-own-a-machine-gun-in-georgia>Is it illegal to own a machine gun in Georgia?</h2>
<p>Georgia Code 16-11-122 and 16-11-124 (4) prohibit the possession of a short barreled rifle or shotgun, silencer, explosive device, or machine gun. 1 Exempt from this prohibition are persons authorized to possess such an item because he has registered it in accordance with the National Firearms Act.</p>
