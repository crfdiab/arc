<h2 id=what-are-the-contributions-of-asia>What are the contributions of Asia?</h2>
<p>Asia’s great civilizations: like those of India, China and Japan, have made great contributions to the world civilization. Asia is also the home of several major religions in the world, such as Hinduism, Buddhism, Confucianism, Daoism, and Shintoism. Asians are an increasingly important segment of American society.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-most-important-chinese-contribution-to-life-in-east-asia>What was the most important Chinese contribution to life in East Asia?</h2>
<p>It was the Silk Roads (land and maritime) that allowed many of the ideas and technological inventions of East Asian civilization — paper, printing, gunpowder — to reach the West, where their impact was profound. China’s two river systems have also greatly influenced its history and culture.</p>
<h2 id=what-country-has-contributed-the-most-to-other-countries-in-asia>What country has contributed the most to other countries in Asia?</h2>
<p>Asian countries contribute almost 25% of UN budget, with Japan being the highest contributor from the region, followed by China, Australia, South Korea and India.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-invented-in-asia>What was invented in Asia?</h2>
<p>In ancient times, Asian inventors came up with such fripperies as silk, soap, glass, ink, parasols, and kites. Some inventions of a more serious nature also appeared at this time, like writing, irrigation, and map-making.</p>
<h2 id=what-did-the-chinese-contribute-to-the-world>What did the Chinese contribute to the world?</h2>
<p>It is said that for more than 2000 years the Chinese had kept this secret of silk and this is one of the most guarded secrets in the world history. Hsi-Ling-Shih, wife of Yellow Emperor who ruled China in 3000 BC is credited with the introduction of silkworm cultivation and the invention of the loom.</p>
<h2 id=how-is-china-playing-a-role-in-globalization>How is China playing a role in globalization?</h2>
<p>In globalization 4.0, Chinese imports will play an ever-larger role as Chinese multinationals invest across Asia and the world. From now until 2030, China’s consumption growth is expected to exceed that of the US and Western Europe combined.</p>
<h2 id=which-is-the-most-important-economy-in-asia>Which is the most important economy in Asia?</h2>
<p>Solutions that have been adapted to Asia’s diverse conditions may well prove to be useful templates for the rest of the world. Lying at the heart of the regional economy, China will undoubtedly play a central role in the Asian Century.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-role-of-china-in-southeast-asia>What was the role of China in Southeast Asia?</h2>
<p>Same holds true for Southeast Asia, Vietnam in particular. The spread of Buddhism from India through Tibet into traditional China and then outward to northeast and Southeast Asia, along with Confucianist thinking in Northeast Asia, also has provided a unifying foundation.</p>
