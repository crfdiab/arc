<p>The upper classes did wash their hair by stripping to the waist and leaning over a basin, but no shampoo was used. Hair was cleaned with a mixture of ashes, vine stalks and egg whites. Tonics and balms out of broom and vinegar were made to relieve “itch mites”.</p>

<h2 id=how-did-women-wash-their-hair-in-the-1500s>How did women wash their hair in the 1500s?</h2>

<h2 id=what-did-people-use-to-cleanse-their-skin-in-medieval-times>What did people use to cleanse their skin in medieval times?</h2>
<p>During the 12th century, cosmetics were regularly used in medieval Europe. Ointments consisted of animal fats.

<h2 id=why-did-people-wear-skirts-in-the-middle-ages>Why did people wear skirts in the Middle Ages?</h2>
<p>European women were wearing large skirts to conceal the potties they carried underneath. The invention of perfume in France is also often related to Europe’s historical lack of hygene. Europeans were not familiar with the concept of ‘toilet’ during the middle ages. They were taking care of their ‘needs’ on open fields, or inside their houses.</p>
