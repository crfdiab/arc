The British Museum/Opened</p>
<h2 id=when-was-british-museum-built>When was British museum built?</h2>
<p>1753<br>
The British Museum/Founded</p>
<h2 id=who-started-british-museum>Who started British museum?</h2>
<p>Sir Hans Sloane<br>
A physician by trade, Sir Hans Sloane was also a collector of objects from around the world. By his death in 1753 he had collected more than 71,000 items. Sloane bequeathed his collection to the nation in his will and it became the founding collection of the British Museum.</p>
<h2 id=when-did-the-first-open-as-a-museum>When did the first open as a museum?</h2>
<p>The Ashmolean Museum, however, founded in 1677 from the personal collection of Elias Ashmole, was set up in the University of Oxford to be open to the public and is considered by some to be the first modern public museum.</p>
<h2 id=why-is-british-museum-reading-room-closed>Why is British museum Reading Room closed?</h2>
<p>Designed by Sydney Smirke and opened in 1857, the Reading Room was in continual use until its temporary closure for renovation in 1997. It was reopened in 2000, and from 2007 to 2017 it was used to stage temporary exhibitions.</p>
<h2 id=how-old-is-the-oldest-museum>How old is the oldest museum?</h2>
<p>2,500 years ago<br>
The world’s oldest museum was built 2,500 years ago and discovered in 1925 by archaeologist Leonard Wooley.</p>
<h2 id=which-is-the-oldest-museum>Which is the oldest museum?</h2>
<p>1) The Capitoline Museums, Rome. The oldest museum in the world – now that’s an impressive title. Maybe in 5,000 years, New York’s Museum of Ice Cream will be the last cultural institution standing; its exhibits perfectly suited to survive an apocalyptic ice age.</p>
<h2 id=whats-the-oldest-thing-in-the-natural-history-museum>What’s the oldest thing in the Natural History Museum?</h2>
<p>The Natural History Museum is home to the Vigarano meteorite, which fell to Italy from beyond the earth’s atmosphere. The meteorite is the oldest object the museum can date, but it is also home to pre-Solar diamonds, which were formed in the atmosphere of stars that pre-date our sun.</p>
<h2 id=when-did-the-british-museum-first-open-to-the-public>When did the British Museum first open to the public?</h2>
<p>The British Museum was established in 1753, largely based on the collections of the Irish physician and scientist Sir Hans Sloane. It first opened to the public in 1759, in Montagu House, on the site of the current building.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-first-museum-in-the-world>What was the first museum in the world?</h2>
<p>In 1683, a private collection of natural history curiosities was donated to the University of Oxford, where the collection was opened to the public. The Ashmolean Museum thus became the first permanent public exhibition housed by a corporation.</p>
<h2 id=how-big-is-the-collection-of-the-british-museum>How big is the collection of the British Museum?</h2>
<p>The British Museum, in the Bloomsbury area of London, England, is a public institution dedicated to human history, art and culture. Its permanent collection of some eight million works is among the largest and most comprehensive in existence, having been widely collected during the era of the British Empire.</p>
<h2 id=which-is-the-oldest-museum-in-the-uk>Which is the oldest museum in the UK?</h2>
<p>The Leeds site of the Royal Armouries Museum. Located in the Tower of London in the United Kingdom, the Royal Armories is the oldest museum in Britain.</p>

<p>The British Museum was founded in 1753 and opened its doors in 1759. It was the first national museum to cover all fields of human knowledge, open to visitors from across the world.</p>
<h2 id=when-did-golf-become-a-sport-in-england>When did golf become a sport in England?</h2>
<p>When James VI of Scotland became king of England in 1603, his son the Prince of Wales and his courtiers played golf at the Blackheath in London. There is evidence that the Scottish soldiers, immigrants, and expatriates brought the game to the British colonies and other areas in the 18th and early 19th centuries.</p>
<h2 id=whats-the-history-of-the-game-of-golf>What’s the history of the game of golf?</h2>
<p>The history of golf is mainly centered on the development of the equipment that is used to play. The basic equipment required is a club and golf ball. The golf ball has taken many different forms and materials through the years, especially prior to the 1930s.</p>
<h2 id=where-was-the-first-golf-course-in-the-world>Where was the first golf course in the world?</h2>
<p>There has always been a debate about the origins of golf. It is generally agreed that at least modern golf was developed in Scotland around the Middle Ages. However, not until the 19th century was it popular internationally spreading through the United Kingdom, the British Empire, then the United States.</p>
