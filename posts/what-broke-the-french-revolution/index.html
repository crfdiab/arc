<h2 id=what-broke-the-french-revolution>What broke the French Revolution?</h2>
<p>The French Revolution began in 1789 and lasted until 1794. King Louis XVI needed more money, but had failed to raise more taxes when he had called a meeting of the Estates General. This instead turned into a protest about conditions in France. The Republic of France was declared, and soon the King was put on trial.</p>
<h2 id=who-ruled-france-when-the-revolution-broke-out-class-9>Who ruled France when the Revolution broke out class 9?</h2>
<p>-The Revolt reached its logical conclusion when on 9 November 1799, Napoleon Bonaparte resumed the leadership of France. -So the time of the French Revolution is from 5 May 1789 (General Assembly of the States) to 9 November 17999 ( Napoleon as Emperor).</p>

<p>King Louis XVI<br>
King Louis XVI of the House of Bourbon had been overthrown and executed during the French Revolution (1789–1799), which in turn was followed by Napoleon as ruler of France.</p>
<h2 id=who-are-the-members-of-the-french-general-assembly>Who are the members of the French General Assembly?</h2>
<p>It was made up of clergy (the First Estate), nobility (the Second Estate), and commoners (the Third Estate). A general assembly representing the French estates of the realm: the clergy (First Estate), the nobles (Second Estate), and the common people (Third Estate).</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-purpose-of-the-french-national-assembly>What was the purpose of the French National Assembly?</h2>
<p>A general assembly representing the French estates of the realm: the clergy (First Estate), the nobles (Second Estate), and the common people (Third Estate). The Estates-General, convened by Louis XVI to deal with France’s financial crisis, assembled on May 5, 1789.</p>
<h2 id=how-was-society-divided-during-the-french-revolution>How was society divided during the French Revolution?</h2>
<p>Different systems for dividing society members into estates evolved over time. The best-known system is the French Ancien Régime (Old Regime), a three-estate system used until the French Revolution (1789–1799). It was made up of clergy (the First Estate), nobility (the Second Estate), and commoners (the Third Estate).</p>
<h2 id=who-are-the-members-of-the-national-assembly>Who are the members of the National Assembly?</h2>
<p>Its members had been elected to represent the estates of the realm: the 1st Estate (the clergy), the 2nd Estate (the nobility) and the 3rd Estate (which, in theory, represented all of the commoners and, in practice, represented the bourgeoisie ).</p>
