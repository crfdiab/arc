<p>40 years<br>
A guide to the Palace of Versailles, France. Orange trees outline a formal garden at Versailles, once the epicenter of French royal power. The Versailles gardens took 40 years to complete, and Louis XIV valued them as much as the palace.</p>
<h2 id=how-long-was-versailles-built>How long was Versailles built?</h2>
<p>It was a small country residence and, according to the Maréchal de Bassompierre, “a mere gentleman would not have been overly proud of the construction.” Louis XIII decided to rebuild it in 1631. Construction continued until 1634 and laid the basis of the Palace we know today.</p>
<h2 id=why-did-king-louis-xiv-14th-build-versailles-12-miles-away-from-paris>Why did King Louis XIV 14th build Versailles 12 miles away from Paris?</h2>
<p>Louis and his queen, Marie Antoinette, were executed in 1793. 12 miles from Paris where Louis XIV built a palace for himself to put distance between himself and his people. It was the center of political power in France from 1682. Versailles started as a hunting lodge for Louis VIII.</p>

<p>Besides any political motivations Louis XIV may have had for relocating the palace, Versailles also served to glorify this powerful king. As the Sun King, Louis XIV emphasized his divine right to rule and his unquestionable power. The king’s bedroom was at the center of the palace.</p>

<p>Charles Le Brun designed the paintings on the walls and ceilings and many of the park sculptures. In 1685, 36 000 people and 6 000 horses were working on the construction of the 500 meters long Palace. It took fifty years altogether to build Versailles Palace. Sun King reigned 72 years from 1643 to 1715.</p>

<p>Louis XIV, king of France (1643–1715), ruled his country, principally from his great palace at Versailles, during one of the country’s most brilliant periods. Today he remains the symbol of absolute monarchy of the classical age. How old was Louis XIV when he acceded to the throne?</p>
<h2 id=who-was-the-king-of-france-during-the-versailles-revolution>Who was the king of France during the Versailles Revolution?</h2>
<p>Until his death in 1715, Versailles remained the heart of the most powerful kingdom of Europe. His successors, Louis XV and Louis XVI, ruled France from Versailles until 1789 when the revolution put an end to the glorious and royal history of the palace.</p>
