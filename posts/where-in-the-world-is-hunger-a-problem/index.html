<h2 id=where-in-the-world-is-hunger-a-problem>Where in the world is hunger a problem?</h2>
<p>Nearly all of the world’s undernourished people live in developing countries. In fact, about two out of three of the world’s chronically-undernourished people live in Asia. Sub-Saharan Africa still remains the region with the worst hunger problems, where more than one in four people are undernourished.</p>
<h2 id=is-hunger-a-problem-in-new-zealand>Is hunger a problem in New Zealand?</h2>
<p>Hunger and Poverty in New Zealand Though it is a relatively wealthy country, many New Zealanders live with food insecurity. Defined as a lack of access to healthy and nutritious food, food insecurity has negative effects on families, children, health and even mental health.</p>
<h2 id=which-country-has-the-least-food>Which country has the least food?</h2>
<p>Ethiopia remains one of the world’s least developed countries, ranked 174 out of 187 in the 2011 UNDP Human Development Index. 33.4% of the population of Madagascar are undernourished.</p>
<h2 id=can-we-solve-world-hunger>Can we solve world hunger?</h2>
<p>Can we end world hunger? Yes. 193 countries have signed an agreement committing to end all forms of malnutrition by 2030. The United Nations Division for Sustainable Development Goals (#2) states “End hunger, achieve food security and improved nutrition and promote sustainable agriculture.”</p>
<h2 id=what-causes-world-hunger>What causes world hunger?</h2>
<p>Poverty is the principal cause of global hunger. The unequal distribution of income and lack of resources in developing countries means that millions of people simply cannot afford the land or farming supplies they need to grow, or otherwise gain access to nutritious food.</p>
<h2 id=does-new-zealand-have-enough-food>Does New Zealand have enough food?</h2>
<p>New Zealand produces enough food to feed about 40 million people.</p>
<h2 id=which-is-the-hungriest-country-in-the-world>Which is the hungriest country in the world?</h2>
<p>COVID-19 has made it clear that our food systems, as they stand, are inadequate to the task of achieving Zero Hunger, even if the world does produce enough food to feed all of its inhabitants. Here, according to the 2020 Global Hunger Index, are the current top 10 hungriest countries. 10. Nigeria</p>
<h2 id=what-are-the-global-issues-of-world-hunger>What are the global issues of world hunger?</h2>
<p>For an issue that goes to the heart of humanity it also has its ugly side. This issue explores topics ranging from the global food crisis of 2008, to issues of food aid, world hunger, food dumping and wasteful agriculture such as growing tobacco, sugar, beef, and more. Read “ Food and Agriculture Issues ” to learn more.</p>
<h2 id=how-is-world-hunger-a-symptom-of-poverty>How is world hunger a symptom of poverty?</h2>
<p>World hunger is a terrible symptom of world poverty. If efforts are only directed at providing food, or improving food production or distribution, then the structural root causes that create hunger, poverty and dependency would still remain.</p>
<h2 id=when-was-the-last-update-on-world-hunger>When was the last update on world hunger?</h2>
<p>Last updated Sunday, October 24, 2010. Solving world hunger in the conventional sense (of providing/growing more food etc) will not tackle poverty that leads to hunger in the first place.</p>
