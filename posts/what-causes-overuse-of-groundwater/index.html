<h2 id=what-causes-overuse-of-groundwater>What causes overuse of groundwater?</h2>
<p>Excessive pumping can lower the groundwater table, and cause wells to no longer be able to reach groundwater. This is most often caused by human activities, mainly from the overuse of groundwater, when the soil collapses, compacts, and drops.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-the-major-causes-of-groundwater-depletion-in-india>What are the major causes of groundwater depletion in India?</h2>
<p>Demand Side reason:</p>
<ul>
<li>Intensive ground water-based irrigation agriculture and excess withdrawal of groundwater due to unmetered pump or flat bill or subsidized rate of electrical.</li>
<li>Due to MSP and other policies, the cultivation of water intense crops is growing.</li>
<li>Overpopulation is causing more demand for water.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id=what-are-the-effects-of-overuse-of-groundwater-resources>What are the effects of overuse of groundwater resources?</h2>
<p>Over development of groundwater environment could lead to drying up of wells and decrease in water levels. It could also result in drying up of streams and lakes apart from causing induced pollution, Arun P.R., a scientist at the Centre for Water Resources Development and Management, Kunnamangalam, says.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-importance-of-groundwater-in-india>What is the importance of groundwater in India?</h2>
<p>Groundwater is an important natural resource to meet the water requirements of our country. Groundwater irrigation has been expanding at a very rapid pace in India since 1970s and now accounts for over 60 percent of the total area irrigated in the country.</p>
<h2 id=how-much-ground-of-india-are-being-overused>How much ground of India are being overused?</h2>
<p>Answer: your answer is option c about 30 percent .</p>
<h2 id=how-do-you-solve-groundwater-problems>How do you solve groundwater problems?</h2>
<p>Ways to Protect and Conserve Groundwater</p>
<ol>
<li>Go Native. Use native plants in your landscape.</li>
<li>Reduce Chemical Use.</li>
<li>Manage Waste.</li>
<li>Don’t Let It Run.</li>
<li>Fix the Drip.</li>
<li>Wash Smarter.</li>
<li>Water Wisely.</li>
<li>Reduce, Reuse, and Recycle.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id=why-is-there-a-groundwater-problem-in-india>Why is there a groundwater problem in India?</h2>
<p>The first is depletion. Our wells and springs are drying up, and as a consequence of this depletion, our groundwater quality is also deteriorating. When there is less water in an aquifer, the concentration of ions increases. When aquifers get recharged sufficiently, contaminants are diluted.</p>
<h2 id=why-is-ground-water-a-highly-overused-resource>Why is ground water a highly overused resource?</h2>
<p>Now-a-days groundwater is highly overused because of many reasons, some of which are as follows. (i) Groundwater is a fresh water source and can be used for drinking purpose. It is actually over exploited in urban areas for domestic use and drinking purpose. (ii) Groundwater is extensively used for irrigation purpose, especially in North India.</p>
<h2 id=why-is-there-water-scarcity-in-rural-india>Why is there water scarcity in rural India?</h2>
<p>In rural India, water scarcity is also the result of untested agricultural practices, such as cultivating more water-consuming crops – paddy, cotton and sugarcane – in areas riddled with water scarcity. According to the Report of Central Ground Water Board, more than half of India’s groundwater is contaminated.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-the-negative-effects-of-groundwater-depletion>What are the negative effects of groundwater depletion?</h2>
<p>Some of the negative effects of groundwater depletion: Lowering of the Water Table Increased Costs Reduced Surface Water Supplies Land Subsidence Water Quality Concerns</p>
