<h2 id=what-is-it-called-when-the-sun-and-moon-are-on-the-same-side-of-the-earth>What is it called when the Sun and moon are on the same side of the Earth?</h2>
<p>Photo by Brad Snowder. New phase occurs when the Sun and Moon are on the same side of the Earth and we see only the dark side.</p>
<h2 id=can-moon-and-sun-be-on-the-same-side>Can moon and Sun be on the same side?</h2>
<p>Every possible variation of the angle between the Sun and Moon can be seen. Sometimes they appear together almost exactly in the same position (as in a total Solar Eclipse), sometimes they’re on almost exactly the opposite sides of the sky (as in a total Lunar eclipse).</p>
<h2 id=why-is-the-moon-going-down-at-night>Why is the Moon going down at night?</h2>
<p>Simple explanation: It appears to be going down because it temporarily moves out of sight. It’s always visible somewhere on Earth just like the sun. The moon revolves around the Earth just as the Earth revolves around the sun. They both move in and out of sight at different times and places on Earth.</p>
<h2 id=why-does-the-moon-have-the-same-phase-as-the-sun>Why does the Moon have the same phase as the Sun?</h2>
<p>The moon will have the same phase and be at the same node and the same distance from Earth. Earth will be nearly the same distance from the sun, and tilted to it in nearly the same orientation. The extra eight hours is the reason why successive eclipses in the same saros cycle happen over different parts of Earth.</p>
<h2 id=can-a-solar-eclipse-happen-when-the-moon-is-closest-to-the-sun>Can a solar eclipse happen when the Moon is closest to the Sun?</h2>
<p>It’s the point in the moon’s orbit when it passes between Earth and the sun. A total solar eclipse can only happen at a new moon, and only when the other types of movement line up as well. When the moon, on its orbit around Earth, reaches the point closest to the sun we can’t see the moon reflecting sunlight, so it appears dark.</p>
<h2 id=when-is-the-moon-on-the-far-side-of-the-earth>When is the Moon on the far side of the Earth?</h2>
<p>Then about 7 days and 9 hours later the Moon will be on the far side of the Earth opposite the Sun.</p>
<h2 id=why-does-the-moon-orbit-around-the-sun>Why does the Moon orbit around the Sun?</h2>
<p>In reality, however, the Earth is actually snaking back and forth slightly in its orbit around the Sun because of the Moon’s mass and the fact that the Moon isn’t technically orbiting the Earth, but rather that they are orbiting each other around a point just beneath the Earth’s surface in whatever direction the Moon happens to be in at that time.</p>
