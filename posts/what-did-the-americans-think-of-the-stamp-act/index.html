<h2 id=what-did-the-americans-think-of-the-stamp-act>What did the Americans think of the Stamp Act?</h2>
<p>The tax collectors were threatened or made to quit their jobs. They even burned the stamped paper in the streets. The colonies also boycotted British products and merchants. The American colonies felt so strongly against the Stamp Act that they called a meeting of all the colonies.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-american-colonists-protest-the-stamp-act>How did American colonists protest the Stamp Act?</h2>
<p>Colonists React to the Stamp Act An angry mob protest against the Stamp Act by carrying a banner reading ‘The Folly of England, the Ruin of America’ through the streets of New York. Newspapers throughout the colonies reprinted the resolutions, spreading their radical message to a broad audience.</p>
<h2 id=did-americans-boycott-the-stamp-act>Did Americans boycott the Stamp Act?</h2>
<p>Most Americans called for a boycott of British goods, and some organized attacks on the customhouses and homes of tax collectors. After months of protest, and an appeal by Benjamin Franklin before the British House of Commons, Parliament voted to repeal the Stamp Act in March 1766.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-slogan-of-the-americans-in-response-to-the-stamp-act>What was the slogan of the Americans in response to the Stamp Act?</h2>
<p>The well-known slogan “no taxation without representation,” which colonists adopted in protest of the Stamp Act, was meant to problematize Parliament’s claim to legislative authority over the colonies.</p>
<h2 id=why-did-the-colonists-not-like-the-stamp-act>Why did the colonists not like the Stamp Act?</h2>
<p>The colonists didn’t feel the same. The colonists felt that the British government had no right to tax them because there were not any representatives of the colonies in the British Parliament. The colonies had no say in how much the taxes should be or what they should pay for.</p>
<h2 id=when-did-the-stamp-act-come-into-effect>When did the Stamp Act come into effect?</h2>
<p>The Stamp Act was passed on March 22, 1765 but it didn’t take effect until November 1 of 1765. The following are some facts about the Stamp Act: The Stamp Act was an act passed by Parliament that required that all materials printed in the colonies be printed on paper embossed with an official revenue stamp.</p>
<h2 id=why-was-the-stamp-act-a-violation-of-american-rights>Why was the Stamp Act a violation of American rights?</h2>
<p>Because Parliament, not their own provincial assemblies, passed the act, Americans considered it a violation of their rights as British subjects. As they understood the British constitution, the people must consent to taxes through their representatives.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-the-stamp-act-reduce-the-national-debt>How did the Stamp Act reduce the national debt?</h2>
<p>The Stamp Act was another part of Grenville’s plan to reduce the national debt. It cost an estimated 350,000 pounds to finance the troops and Grenville estimated the Stamp Act would raise about 60,000 pounds of the cost. When the Sugar Act was passed in April of 1764, Grenville mentioned that a stamp tax was being considered for the future.</p>
