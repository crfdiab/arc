<h2 id=why-is-land-so-important-to-indigenous-peoples-canada>Why is land so important to indigenous peoples Canada?</h2>
<p>However, land is much beyond just an economic asset for Indigenous peoples. Land provides sustenance for current and future generations; it is connected to spiritual beliefs, traditional knowledge and teachings; it is fundamental to cultural reproduction; moreover, commonly held land rights reinforce nationhood.</p>
<h2 id=is-aboriginal-used-in-canada>Is Aboriginal used in Canada?</h2>
<p>The Canadian Constitution recognizes three groups of Aboriginal peoples: Indians (more commonly referred to as First Nations), Inuit and Métis. However, the term Aboriginal is still used and accepted.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-the-aboriginal-people-contribute-to-canada>How did the Aboriginal people contribute to Canada?</h2>
<p>Each of these groups of settlers had contributed to the rise of the country in several ways. Among the many inhabitants throughout the history of Canada, Canadian Indians had one of the greatest influence on the country’s economy and provided a very rich cultural heritage.</p>
<h2 id=how-many-indigenous-people-are-there-in-canada>How many indigenous people are there in Canada?</h2>
<p>In Canada, the term Indigenous peoples (or Aboriginal peoples) refers to First Nations, Métis and Inuit peoples. These are the original inhabitants of the land that is now Canada. In the 2016 census by Statistics Canada, over 1.6 million people in Canada identified as Indigenous, making up 4.9 per cent of the national population.</p>

<p>Merely 21 years ago. Today, indigenous women across Canada are getting murdered at a rate that’s 4.5 times higher than any other women in the country and the suicide rate among aboriginal groups is much higher than any other group of people in Canada.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-history-of-land-ownership-in-canada>What was the history of land ownership in Canada?</h2>
<p>Greer spoke with Nelle Oosterom of Canada’s History magazine about his research into the history of land ownership. “It’s an attempt to get a better understanding of the basic processes of colonization, with the dispossession of indigenous people and creation of property of land for settlers,” says Greer.</p>
