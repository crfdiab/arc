<h2 id=why-does-a-dam-need-to-be-thicker-at-the-bottom>Why does a dam need to be thicker at the bottom?</h2>
<p>The pressure applied to walls of the dam will be a function of the amount of water that is over that particular point on the wall. So water pressure is very large at the bottom due to its large depth. That’s why dams are constructed thicker at their bottoms than at their tops.</p>
<h2 id=why-dams-are-made-broader-at-the-bottom-than-at-the-top>Why dams are made broader at the bottom than at the top?</h2>
<p>The reason is that the pressure increases as we go deeper and deeper into the water. So, the pressure is greatest at the bottom of the water. So, to withstand the pressure, dams are made broader at the bottom.</p>
<h2 id=why-would-it-be-harder-to-stop-the-leak-if-the-whole-was-near-the-bottom-of-the-dam-as-compared-to-near-the-top>Why would it be harder to stop the leak if the whole was near the bottom of the dam as compared to near the top?</h2>
<p>This is because the pressure of the water is much greater deeper down and the dam needs to be thick at the bottom so that it is strong enough to withstand this larger pressure.</p>
<h2 id=what-happens-to-the-pressure-if-the-area-is-halved-and-doubled>What happens to the pressure if the area is halved and doubled?</h2>
<p>b) Area over which force acts. When area is doubled , the impact on pressure acting on a object will be decreased . If area is halved, then the impact of pressure acting on the object will be increased.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-a-dam-built-on-class-4>What is a dam built on Class 4?</h2>
<p>A dam is a barrier that stops or restricts the flow of water or underground streams. Reservoirs created by dams not only suppress floods but also provide water for activities such as irrigation, human consumption, industrial use, aquaculture, and navigability.</p>
<h2 id=how-will-the-pressure-change-if-area-of-contact-is-doubled>How will the pressure change if area of contact is doubled?</h2>
<p>When the surface area is doubled, keeping the force constant, the pressure will decrease.</p>
<h2 id=what-will-happen-to-the-pressure-if-we-keep-the-force-constant-and-change-the-area>What will happen to the pressure if we keep the force constant and change the area?</h2>
<p>Answer: 1. If area is doubled keeping the force constant, then pressure becomes half. If force is doubled keeping area constant, then pressure becomes double.</p>
<h2 id=why-are-dams-thicker-at-the-bottom-than-at-the-top>Why are dams thicker at the bottom than at the top?</h2>
<p>Water pressure increases proportionally with depth, so the lower portion of the dam has greater water pressure exerted upon it. The increasing thickness of the lower dam also helps it support its own weight. Dam construction reflects the variety of forces that act upon it.</p>
<h2 id=what-happens-to-the-water-when-a-dam-is-built>What happens to the water when a dam is built?</h2>
<p>This is a complex question and answer. The short version is yes – especially downstream. When the stream enters the lake behind the dam, its velocity drops suddenly, and therefore so does its energy, and any sediments that it is carrying (and moving water is always carrying something).</p>
<h2 id=whats-the-difference-between-a-dam-and-a-lake>What’s the difference between a dam and a lake?</h2>
<p>Dams are man-made lakes on rivers. I think the correct definition is, the dam is the structure itself, not the water or space that hold water Lake is a larg surrounded water body and dam is a large strong obsatcle in river to oppose or change the movement of waters.</p>
<h2 id=why-are-there-so-many-dams-in-america>Why are there so many dams in America?</h2>
<p>The era of widespread construction of large dams for the most part ended in the 1960s and ‘70s. But recently, proposals for new dams have emerged, mostly in the name of improving water supplies strained by urban growth, a desire to irrigate more cropland, or adapting to expected changes in precipitation patterns accompanying climate change.</p>
