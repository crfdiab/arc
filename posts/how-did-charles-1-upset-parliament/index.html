<h2 id=how-did-charles-1-upset-parliament>How did Charles 1 upset Parliament?</h2>
<p>Charles dissolved parliament three times between 1625 and 1629. In 1629, he dismissed parliament and resolved to rule alone. Unrest in Scotland – because Charles attempted to force a new prayer book on the country – put an end to his personal rule. He was forced to call parliament to obtain funds to fight the Scots.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-charles-i-conflict-with-parliament>What was Charles I conflict with Parliament?</h2>
<p>From the beginning of his reign, Charles I demonstrated a distrust of the House of Commons. Parliament was critical of his government, condemning his policies of arbitrary taxation and imprisonment. In 1641 Parliament presented to Charles I the Grand Remonstrance, listing grievances against the king.</p>
<h2 id=what-did-the-struggle-between-king-charles-and-parliament-result-in>What did the struggle between King Charles and Parliament result in?</h2>
<p>The escalating conflict between Charles I of England and the English Parliament resulted in the English Civil War, in the aftermath of which monarchy disappeared for over a decade and Oliver Cromwell ruled as Lord Protector of the Commonwealth of England, Scotland, and Ireland.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-king-charles-i-get-rid-of-parliament>How did King Charles I get rid of Parliament?</h2>
<p>Charles used a private ‘Court of the Star Chamber’ to try and punish his opponents. When Parliament complained in 1629, he dismissed them. Until 1640, Charles ruled without a Parliament, a period known as the ‘Eleven Years Tyranny’.</p>
<h2 id=what-did-king-charles-do-to-upset-the-people-of-england>What did King Charles do to upset the people of England?</h2>
<p>This was all well and good but it never sat well with the Stuarts of which Charles I was the second and rather confusingly Charles II was the third whilst James II was the fourth. The Stuarts preferred a more French style of governship where the king ruled with an iron glove. The limited monarchy of England chafed.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-relationship-between-charles-i-and-parliament>What was the relationship between Charles I and Parliament?</h2>
<p>A summary of Charles I, Civil War and the Restoration Charles came to the throne in 1625. Relations between Charles I and Parliament gradually got worse. There were clashes about foreign policy and many Puritan Protestants disliked Charles’ religious policy.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-king-charles-i-undermining-his-liberties>How did King Charles I undermining his liberties?</h2>
<p>People came to believe that Charles was undermining their liberties or rights: Charles used a private ‘Court of the Star Chamber’ to try and punish his opponents. When Parliament complained in 1629, he dismissed them. Until 1640, Charles ruled without a Parliament, a period known as the ‘Eleven Years Tyranny’.</p>
