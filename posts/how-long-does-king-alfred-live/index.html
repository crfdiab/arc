<p>Alfred, also spelled Aelfred, byname Alfred the Great, (born 849—died 899), king of Wessex (871–899), a Saxon kingdom in southwestern England.</p>
<h2 id=how-old-did-alfred-live>How old did Alfred live?</h2>
<p>By the 890s, Alfred’s charters and coinage (which he had also reformed, extending its minting to the burhs he had founded) referred to him as ‘king of the English’, and Welsh kings sought alliances with him. Alfred died in 899, aged 50, and was buried in Winchester, the burial place of the West Saxon royal family.</p>
