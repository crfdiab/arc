<h2 id=do-the-french-have-bbqs>Do the french have BBQs?</h2>
<p>Grilling. True or false: The French don’t barbecue. Chef Fabrice says, “True. We do not really barbecue the way it’s done in much of the United States.”</p>
<h2 id=can-you-bbq-on-the-beach-in-france>Can you BBQ on the beach in France?</h2>
<p>Under French national law most beach rules include a ban smoking (often flouted), alcohol, fishing and wood fires. Some town halls have banned barbeques at local beaches.</p>
<h2 id=what-do-the-french-bbq>What do the French BBQ?</h2>
<p>A casual French BBQ with friends, petanque, brochette, merguez and harissa. In France, we do barbecue or BBQ mostly with Merguez (Lamb sausages) and brochettes (vegetables/ meat on skewers) served with salads and rice. We rarely do burgers or hot dogs like in the States.</p>
<h2 id=what-should-i-bring-to-a-french-bbq>What should I bring to a French BBQ?</h2>
<ol>
<li>Merguez. These long, thin, alarmingly red sausages are an absolute must-have at a French barbecue.</li>
<li>All the other sausages. I’m now going to say something many Brits would consider unconscionable: I prefer French sausages.</li>
<li>Marinated meats.</li>
<li>Brochettes.</li>
<li>Côte de boeuf.</li>
<li>Seafood and fish.</li>
<li>Vegetarian options galore (joke)</li>
<li>Rosé wine.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id=is-it-the-law-to-wear-speedos-in-france>Is it the law to wear Speedos in France?</h2>
<p>In France, swimming shorts are not allowed to be worn in swimming pools by men. In France, men must wear clinging swimming trunks to swimming pools. You have to wear tight fitting teeny weeny Speedo style swimming trunks to the pool in France because its more hygienic.</p>
<h2 id=why-cant-you-wear-swimming-shorts-in-france>Why can’t you wear swimming shorts in France?</h2>
<p>Originally Answered: Why are swimming shorts banned in France? They are not “banned in France” – they are banned from public swimming pools. Most public beaches don’t care. The main reason is that of hygiene – swimming shorts are often worn on the street too, and as such can be quite dirty.</p>
<h2 id=why-cant-you-wear-shorts-in-french-swimming-pools>Why can’t you wear shorts in French swimming pools?</h2>
<p>“Hygiene,” says Emmanuel Dormois, a head pool attendant in Paris’s 11th arrondissement. “Small, tight trunks can only be used for swimming. Bermudas or bigger swimming shorts can be worn elsewhere all day, so could bring in sand, dust or other matter, disturbing the water quality.</p>
<h2 id=can-you-wear-shorts-in-france>Can you wear shorts in France?</h2>
<p>France is a free country, you can wear shorts in Paris anytime and anywhere, except perhaps in high-end restaurants with dress codes, or possibly religious institutions that prohibit bare legs (or shoulders).</p>

<h2 id=is-it-weird-for-a-girl-to-wear-swim-shorts>Is it weird for a girl to wear swim shorts?</h2>
<p>Women obviously don’t want to wear baggy swim shorts but many women expect men to wear them. Almost all women wear essentially speedos from the waist down to swim or suntan in however quite a few women object to men wearing speedos.</p>
<h2 id=can-you-wear-a-sports-bra-to-swim>Can you wear a sports bra to swim?</h2>
<p>Absolutely yes! There is no physical reason you cannot swim in a sports bra. It may not be good for your bra but given how supportive and low impact water-based activities are it is perfectly fine to jump in, sports bra and all.</p>
