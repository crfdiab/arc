<h2 id=why-are-olives-and-grapes-grown-together>Why are olives and grapes grown together?</h2>
<p>Olives and Grapes as Companions Climate is one reason that grapes and olives make good companion plants. Both crops are also self-pollinating – neither need insects nor birds to carry pollen between flowers – and olive trees shelter grape vines against strong winds that can disrupt pollination.</p>
<h2 id=how-are-grapes-and-olives-related>How are grapes and olives related?</h2>
<p>Olive and grape plants are both flowering plants, and they are both in the Eudicots, one of the 8 subgroups of flowering plants. Beyond that their relatedness ends, they are in different Orders. So not very closely related, for example humans and dogs are also both in the same Class but different Orders.</p>
<h2 id=are-olives-native-to-italy>Are olives native to Italy?</h2>
<p>Olives are native to the Mediterranean region. Evidence from archaeological digs proves that olives were grown in Crete in 2500 B.C. From there, the popularity of the olive spread to Greece, Rome and other Mediterranean districts.</p>
<h2 id=are-olives-big-in-italy>Are olives big in Italy?</h2>
<p>Italy has an olive growing area of 1 075 000 ha, of which 21% is irrigated while the rest is rain-fed. In Italy there are over 500 varieties of olive trees and more than 90% of oil production is obtained from some 45 varieties.</p>
<h2 id=what-should-i-plant-next-to-grapes>What should I plant next to grapes?</h2>
<p>Excellent companions for grapes include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Hyssop.</li>
<li>Oregano.</li>
<li>Basil.</li>
<li>Beans.</li>
<li>Blackberries.</li>
<li>Clover.</li>
<li>Geraniums.</li>
<li>Peas.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id=what-can-you-not-plant-near-grape-vines>What can you not plant near grape vines?</h2>
<p>Some vegetables are harmful to grapes and can stymie their growth. Never plant collard greens, such as lettuce (Lactuca sativa) and cabbage (Brassica oleracea var. Capitata) or garlic (Allium sativum), next to grapes.</p>
<h2 id=are-olives-made-out-of-grapes>Are olives made out of grapes?</h2>
<p>The olive is a drupe or stone fruit, like cherries, peaches, and plums, in which a fleshy outer covering surrounds a pit or stone, which in turn encases a seed. The Old Testament is awash in references to olives, listed along with such desirables as honey, figs, grapes, and pomegranates.</p>
<h2 id=can-dogs-eat-olives>Can dogs eat olives?</h2>
<p>Dogs can eat olives in moderation. They contain many vitamins and minerals important for human health, though dogs fed a complete and balanced diet don’t need these additional nutrients. However, plain, unsalted olives can be a healthy snack for your pup. Plain, pitted olives rarely cause problems in dogs.</p>
<h2 id=what-olives-do-italians-eat>What olives do Italians eat?</h2>
<p>Five Famous Italian olives</p>
<ul>
<li>Leccino. Grown all across Italy, but believed to have originated in Tuscany, this is one of the most popular olive varieties in the world.</li>
<li>Frantoio. Second to Leccino, Frantoio olives are some of the most common in Italy, especially in Tuscany.</li>
<li>Moraiolo.</li>
<li>Nocellara.</li>
<li>Coratina.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id=why-are-olive-trees-planted-around-grape-vines>Why are olive trees planted around grape vines?</h2>
<p>Both crops are also self-pollinating — neither need insects nor birds to carry pollen between flowers — and olive trees shelter grape vines against strong winds that can disrupt pollination. Both crops produce fine pollen that moves most successfully in dry weather and clumps in wet weather.</p>
<h2 id=why-are-grapes-and-olives-good-companion-plants>Why are grapes and olives good companion plants?</h2>
<p>Growing Conditions. Climate is one reason that grapes and olives make good companion plants. Both crops are also self-pollinating — neither need insects nor birds to carry pollen between flowers — and olive trees shelter grape vines against strong winds that can disrupt pollination.</p>

<h2 id=why-are-so-many-olive-trees-dying-in-europe>Why are so many olive trees dying in Europe?</h2>
<p>In many places in Europe, olive trees are suffering from disease (See Europe’s Olive Trees a Are Dying .) About 90 percent of the world’s olive crop goes to make olive oil.</p>
