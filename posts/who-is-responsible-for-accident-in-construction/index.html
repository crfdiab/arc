<h2 id=who-is-responsible-for-accident-in-construction>Who is responsible for accident in construction?</h2>
<p>For example: An owner hires a general contractor, who then hires multiple subcontractors to do the actual work. If a worker is injured because one of the subcontractors did not comply with safety regulations, the owner and general contractor are responsible to the injured worker for all injuries and damages.</p>
<h2 id=what-would-you-do-in-case-of-construction-site-accident>What would you do in case of construction site accident?</h2>
<p>Seek medical care. If you have sustained an injury at a construction site, you should seek immediate medical care. Call 911 yourself or have a co-worker do it for you. A medical record which documents the accident and injury can be very persuasive evidence to a Court concerning an accident.</p>
<h2 id=what-category-of-accidents-is-responsible-for-most-construction-site-deaths>What category of accidents is responsible for most construction site deaths?</h2>
<p>fatal four<br>
According to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), the most common types of construction accidents resulting in deaths are classified as the “fatal four.” These common construction site accidents are falls, being struck by an object, electrocution, and getting caught in or between equipment and …</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-most-common-accident-on-a-construction-site>What is the most common accident on a construction site?</h2>
<p>Tripping Hazards Slips, trips and falls are the most common accident in any workplace. And the construction site is no different. Workers can easily find themselves tripping over loose cables or even falling into holes in the ground that have been dug and not signed or cordoned off correctly.</p>
<h2 id=how-does-communication-play-an-important-role-in-construction-safety>How does communication play an important role in construction safety?</h2>
<p>Effective communication is vital to the successful completion of any construction project. Good communication can improve teamwork and lead to better project collaboration. Poor communication can result in misunderstandings, delays, and issues down the road.</p>
<h2 id=what-to-do-if-an-accident-occurs-in-the-workplace>What to do if an accident occurs in the workplace?</h2>
<p>What To Do If An Accident Occurs In The Workplace</p>
<ol>
<li>Assess Your Injuries And Get Them Treated At The Earliest.</li>
<li>Get Photographic And Video Evidence Of The Scene Of The Accident.</li>
<li>Report The Accident To Your Manager.</li>
<li>Record The Accident In The Workplace Accident Book.</li>
<li>Keep A Detailed Record Of Your Expenses And Losses.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id=what-is-the-difference-between-intentional-and-unintentional-injuries>What is the difference between intentional and unintentional injuries?</h2>
<p>Intentional injuries are injuries that occur with purposeful intent and include homicide, suicide, domestic violence, sexual assault and rape, bias related violence and firearms. Unintentional injuries are injuries that occur without purposeful intent, and are a leading cause of death and disability.</p>
<h2 id=what-causes-the-most-deaths-on-a-construction-site>What causes the most deaths on a construction site?</h2>
<p>Caught Between Objects According to 2012 data, approximately two percent of construction site fatalities were caused by workers being caught between objects, which can also include deaths resulting from demolitions, collapsing walls or structures, and more.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-the-top-3-causes-of-fatalities-in-construction>What are the top 3 causes of fatalities in construction?</h2>
<p>According to the UN’s ILO, these are the top causes of deaths on construction sites as of April 2019:</p>
<ul>
<li>Falls.</li>
<li>Electrocution.</li>
<li>Crush injuries.</li>
<li>Caught-between injuries.</li>
<li>Crane collapse.</li>
<li>Fires.</li>
<li>Asbestos, ionising radiation, and cancer-causing chemicals.</li>
<li>Slips and trips.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id=what-diseases-can-occur-on-a-construction-site>What diseases can occur on a construction site?</h2>
<p>The most prevalent diseases in construction are asbestos-related diseases, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), asthma, lung cancer and silicosis.</p>
<h2 id=what-causes-most-construction-deaths>What causes most construction deaths?</h2>
<p>The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) has identified the four leading causes of death in the construction industry as the “Fatal Four.” The majority of construction accidents responsible for worker deaths are falls, struck by an object, electrocutions, and caught in or between.</p>
<h2 id=who-is-responsible-for-a-construction-site-accident>Who is responsible for a construction site accident?</h2>
<p>A prime contractor is only responsible for the work that is outline in his or her prime contract. Prime contractors are also responsible for any work he or she delegates to a sub-contractor, including payment and work quality. If an accident were to occur during the work overseen by a prime contractor, he or she could be held liable.</p>
<h2 id=how-was-the-construction-site-accident-case-settled>How was the construction site accident case settled?</h2>
<p>The case was settled out of court. S-E-A’s ability to accurately evaluate and recreate accidents relies to some degree on expertise using and combining a broad range of advanced technologies.</p>
<h2 id=how-does-s-e-a-help-in-a-construction-site-accident>How does S-E-a help in a construction site accident?</h2>
<p>Combine the collected information to generate a map of the area, locate the excavation site and provide a cross-section of the excavation site. S-E-A’s accurate reconstruction of the accident scene demonstrated that the excavation’s location and safety measures met applicable OSHA and building code requirements.</p>
<h2 id=how-is-a-construction-site-a-case-study>How is a construction site a case study?</h2>
<p>Case Study – Pedestrian Fall at a Construction Site An excavation was dug by a subcontractor to connect the water supply for a new facility to the city water lines. At the end of the day, the area was taped off to prevent unintentional access.</p>
