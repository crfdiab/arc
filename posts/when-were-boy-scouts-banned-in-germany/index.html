<p>And as the 1930s progressed, the Nazis waged war on the groups so popular among German youth. First they banned children’s groups associated with political movements like Communism. And in 1936, they banned all youth groups—including the Boy Scouts—and forced members to become part of the Hitler Youth instead.</p>

<p>Indonesia<br>
Indonesia has the highest number of Scouts The national Scouting organisation of Indonesia, Gerakan Pramuka Indonesia, has over 17 million members making it the world’s largest Scouting organisation.</p>
<h2 id=what-do-girls-wear-in-a-girl-scout-uniform>What do girls wear in a Girl Scout uniform?</h2>
<p>Girls wear the sash, vest, or tunic over designated official apparel or over a white shirt and khaki pants or skirt. The Girl Scout uniform unites girls while also letting them express their individuality through different fashion options and accessories that are perfect for all occasions—both everyday activities or more formal occasions.</p>

<p>I found a terrific resource online to learn about Guiding in Germany. In Germany, Boy Scouts and Girl Scouts are not in separate organizations. They are in one unified group, called Bund der Pfadfinderinnen und Pfadfinder (BdP) (Association of Girl Guides and Boy Scouts).</p>

<p>Girl Scout uniforms adapted as well, introducing five separates that could create 12 different outfits. Among the options were a green A-line jumper, white blouses with trefoil stripes, red ties, and wool berets. The 1980s saw more changes in the social, political, and economic landscape of America.</p>
<h2 id=when-did-the-girl-scouts-change-their-name>When did the Girl Scouts change their name?</h2>
<p>The Girl Guides of American changed its name to Girl Scouts of the United States in 1913. At the time, uniforms were modeled after those of the Girl Guides in England, featuring homemade dark blue middy blouses and skirts with sateen ties, felt campaign hats, and black stockings.</p>
