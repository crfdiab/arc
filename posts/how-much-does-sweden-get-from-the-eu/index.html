<p>Sweden joined the European Union in 1995 and its accession treaty has since obliged it to adopt the euro once the country is found to comply with all the convergence criteria. The EU has accepted that Sweden is staying outside the eurozone on its own decision.</p>

<h2 id=how-does-sweden-work-with-the-european-union>How does Sweden work with the European Union?</h2>
<p>Sweden also communicates with the EU institutions through its permanent representation in Brussels. As Sweden’s “embassy to the EU”, its main task is to ensure that the country’s interests and policies are pursued as effectively as possible in the EU. How much does Sweden pay and receive?</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-gdp-per-capita-when-sweden-joined-the-eu>What was the GDP per capita when Sweden joined the EU?</h2>
<p>There is no question that the Swedish economy has shown a lot of improvement since it joined the union. GDP per capita now stands just under $60,000, which is twice what it was in its last year outside of the union in 1994. In 2013, 57% of Sweden’s net trade was with EU member states.</p>
<h2 id=how-much-does-the-uk-contribute-to-the-eu>How much does the UK contribute to the EU?</h2>
<p>In 2017, its contribution to the EU budget was 0.47% of its GDP. Germany is second on this list, followed by Sweden and the UK, in fourth place, with 0.32% of GDP contributed in 2017. At the other end of the scale, some countries, such as Lithuania, Bulgaria and Hungary, receive between 2.5% and 3% of their GDP from the EU budget.</p>
<h2 id=can-you-travel-to-sweden-from-outside-the-eu>Can you travel to Sweden from outside the EU?</h2>
