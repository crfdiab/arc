<h2 id=what-factors-influence-ozone>What factors influence ozone?</h2>
<p>Daily temperatures, relative humidity, and wind speed can affect ozone levels. In general, warm dry weather is more conducive to ozone formation than cool wet weather. Wind can affect both the location and concentration of ozone pollution.</p>
<h2 id=how-does-ozone-influence-atmospheric-processes>How does ozone influence atmospheric processes?</h2>
<p>Atmospheric ozone has two effects on the temperature balance of the Earth. It absorbs solar ultraviolet radiation, which heats the stratosphere. It also absorbs infrared radiation emitted by the Earth’s surface, effectively trapping heat in the troposphere.</p>
<h2 id=what-effect-does-the-ozone-have-on-life>What effect does the ozone have on life?</h2>
<p>Effects of ozone depletion for humans and the environment Ozone layer depletion causes increased UV radiation levels at the Earth’s surface, which is damaging to human health. Negative effects include increases in certain types of skin cancers, eye cataracts and immune deficiency disorders.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-importance-of-atmospheric-ozone>What is the importance of atmospheric ozone?</h2>
<p>Most ozone resides in the stratosphere (a layer of the atmosphere between 10 and 40 km above us), where it acts as a shield to protect Earth’s surface from the sun’s harmful ultraviolet radiation. With a weakening of this shield, we would be more susceptible to skin cancer, cataracts and impaired immune systems.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-the-effects-of-ozone-on-the-environment>What are the effects of ozone on the environment?</h2>
<p>Other effects include slow growth in plants and increased risk of diseases, besides causing severe weather. Exposure of leaves to ozone will leave them vulnerable to other pollutants. Ozone also has negative effects on the ecosystem. Habitat quality and water together with nutrient cycles change due to ozone.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-the-effects-of-ozone-on-asthmatics>What are the effects of ozone on asthmatics?</h2>
<p>The consistency and coherence of the evidence for effects upon asthmatics suggests that ozone can make asthma symptoms worse and can increase sensitivity to asthma triggers. The relationship between the severity of the effect and the proportion of the population experiencing the effect can be presented as a pyramid.</p>
<h2 id=who-is-at-risk-for-ozone-air-pollution>Who is at risk for ozone air pollution?</h2>
<p>People living with asthma and children, who have not fully developed lungs, are at high risk from effects caused by ozone air pollution. Other groups that suffer more include individuals working or spending more time outdoors, people with low intake of some nutrients including vitamin C, and those having certain genetic characteristics.</p>
<h2 id=where-does-ozone-come-from-in-the-air>Where does ozone come from in the air?</h2>
<p>Exposure occurs both indoors and outdoors. However, the levels of indoor ozone are less than 50% of that found outside. Indoor sources of the gas include electrostatic air cleaners and other machines like the photocopiers.</p>
