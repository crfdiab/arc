<p>Lesson Summary Composite cones are tall, cone shaped volcanoes that produce explosive eruptions. Shield volcanoes form very large, gently sloped volcanoes with a wide base. Cinder cones are the smallest volcanic landform. They are formed from accumulation of many small fragments of ejected material.</p>
<h2 id=how-are-the-three-types-of-volcanoes-different>How are the three types of volcanoes different?</h2>
<p>There are three main types of volcano – composite or strato, shield and dome. Composite volcanoes, sometimes known as strato volcanoes, are steep sided cones formed from layers of ash and [lava] flows. A pyroclastic flow is a superheated mixture of hot steam, ash, rock and dust.</p>
<h2 id=how-are-shield-volcanoes-different-from-stratovolcanoes-and-cinder-cones>How are shield volcanoes different from stratovolcanoes and cinder cones?</h2>
<p>1 Stratovolcanoes (Composite Cones) Stratovolcanoes are tall and cone-shaped. Instead of flat shield volcanoes like in Hawaii, they have bigger peaks. 2 Shield Volcanoes. Shield volcanoes earned their name because they’re shaped like a shield. 3 Cinder Cones. 4 Overview of the types of volcanoes. …</p>
<h2 id=how-tall-does-a-cinder-cone-volcano-get>How tall does a cinder cone volcano get?</h2>
<p>Cinder cone volcanoes are relatively small, rarely exceeding 1,000 feet tall. Composite volcanoes, also known as stratovolcanoes, are towering structures, often rising more than 10,000 feet.</p>
<h2 id=what-kind-of-volcano-is-tall-and-conical-in-shape>What kind of volcano is tall and conical in shape?</h2>
<p>These types of volcanoes are tall and conical in shape. Steep sided composite cones are formed from layers of ashes and cones. When this volcano erupts, a superheated mixture of hot steam, ash, rock and dust are erupted out. The lava flowing from composite volcanoes cools and hardens before spreading far due to highly viscous lava.</p>
<h2 id=what-kind-of-rock-is-a-cinder-cone-made-of>What kind of rock is a cinder cone made of?</h2>
<p>Cinder refers to the pyroclastic fragments, which is composed of rock. Cinder cones are also known as ash cones. Cinder cones are the type of volcano that is formed by pyroclastic fragments like volcanic ashes, solidified lava pieces, volcanic clinkers, pumice and hot gases.</p>
