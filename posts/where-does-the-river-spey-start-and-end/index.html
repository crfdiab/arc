<p>River Spey Fishing Season The River Spey salmon & sea trout fishing season opens on the 11th of February and runs through to the 30th of September each year.

<h2 id=is-the-river-clyde-man-made>Is the river Clyde man made?</h2>
<p>From the Tidal Weir westwards, the river is tidal: a mix of fresh and salt water. The river has been artificially straightened and widened where it passes through the city centre.</p>
<p>After leaving Loch Spey the river gathers numerous burns in the Corrieyarack, Sherramore and Glenshirra Forests. The first sizeable tributary is the Markie Burn which drops out of Glen Markie to the north to enter the waters of Spey impounded behind the Spey Dam.</p>
