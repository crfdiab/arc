<h2 id=what-kind-of-animals-live-in-new-zealand>What kind of animals live in New Zealand?</h2>
<p>The long-tailed and short-tailed bat are the only types of native land mammal in New Zealand. Birds and reptiles dominate New Zealand’s land wildlife. However, introduced land mammals like rabbits, stoats, possums, cats, dogs, rats, etc.</p>
<h2 id=does-new-zealand-have-australian-animals>Does New Zealand have Australian animals?</h2>
<p>Over 70% of marsupials are native to Australia with the most well-known being kangaroos, koalas and possums. Possums can also be found in New Zealand. But aside from all the cool mammals that you’ll no doubt come across in your visit to Aus, they also have a bird that looks like a walking dinosaur!</p>
<h2 id=where-are-wombats-found>Where are wombats found?</h2>
<p>Australia<br>
The Koala’s closest living relative, wombats are endemic to (only found in) Australia and are among the largest burrowing mammals in the world. Wombats are marsupials with brown, tan or grey fur and from their stubby tails to their large skulls they can measure 1.3m long and weigh 36kg.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-the-most-dangerous-animals-in-new-zealand>What are the most dangerous animals in New Zealand?</h2>

</ul>
<h2 id=what-is-the-biggest-animal-in-new-zealand>What is the biggest animal in New Zealand?</h2>
<p>Otago skinks<br>
Otago skinks are New Zealand’s largest at almost a foot long, and they have notable color patterns that make them stand-out amongst the other skinks.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-bad-about-new-zealand>What is bad about New Zealand?</h2>
<p>Everything is expensive, lack of job/career opportunities, far from everywhere. Houses are too expensive, renting an apartment almost take all your salary. As much as we would like to see NZ expanding its population, there’s a lack of job opportunities for locals and new migrants which is the main drawback.</p>
<h2 id=is-healthcare-free-in-new-zealand>Is healthcare free in New Zealand?</h2>
<p>If you’re eligible, you can get free or subsidised health, maternity and disability services in NZ. COVID-19 diagnosis, testing and treatment is free. It does not matter what your citizenship, visa status, nationality or medical insurance coverage is.</p>
<h2 id=how-many-species-of-wombats-are-there-in-australia>How many species of wombats are there in Australia?</h2>
<p>2) There are three different species of wombat These are the common wombat (also known as the bare-nosed wombat), the Southern hairy-nosed wombat, and the Northern hairy-nosed wombat. All three species live in Australia and Tasmania. They have a variety of habitats, including mountains, forests, and grasslands!</p>
<h2 id=are-there-any-northern-hairy-nosed-wombats-left-on-earth>Are there any northern hairy nosed wombats left on Earth?</h2>
<p>Sadly, there are only 115 Northern hairy-nosed wombats left on Earth. Due to food shortages and droughts, this super species has been driven out of their historic habitats. They now live in just two tiny locations in Queensland, Australia. Luckily, conservationists are working hard to help.</p>
<h2 id=how-can-a-wombat-live-without-drinking-water>How can a wombat live without drinking water?</h2>
<p>How can wombats live without water? Southern hairy-nosed wombats can live for long periods without drinking water because they absorb moisture from the food they eat. They also lick dew from leaves and other surfaces to get water, but they will drink when given an opportunity to do so. What Kingdom do Wombats belong to?</p>
<h2 id=how-are-wombats-different-from-the-other-marsupials>How are wombats different from the other marsupials?</h2>
<p>1) Wombats are marsupials Like their tree-climbing cousin, the koala, wombats are marsupials. This means that they are part of a particular group of mammals, who have pouches where their newborn young develop. Wombat babies are born super small and helpless, so the pouch is a safe place for them to grow up and get ready for the world!</p>
