<h2 id=what-country-invaded-and-took-over-the-dutch-colony-of-new-amsterdam>What country invaded and took over the Dutch colony of New Amsterdam?</h2>
<p>In 1664 the English took over New Amsterdam and renamed it New York City after the Duke of York (later James II & VII). After the Second Anglo-Dutch War of 1665–67, England and the United Provinces of the Netherlands agreed to the status quo in the Treaty of Breda.</p>
<h2 id=which-country-took-over-new-netherlands-and-what-did-they-change-the-name-to>Which country took over New Netherlands and what did they change the name to?</h2>
<p>A successful Dutch settlement in the colony grew up on the southern tip of Manhattan Island and was christened New Amsterdam. To legitimatize Dutch claims to New Amsterdam, Dutch governor Peter Minuit formally purchased Manhattan from the local tribe from which it derives it name in 1626.</p>

<p>New Netherland (Dutch: Nieuw Nederland; Latin: Nova Belgica or Novum Belgium) was a 17th-century colony of the Dutch Republic that was located on what is now the east coast of the United States.</p>
<h2 id=when-did-the-dutch-take-over-new-york>When did the Dutch take over New York?</h2>
<p>In 1664, the British took over New Netherland and renamed the colony New York. Around the time of the English victory, the Dutch population is estimated to be around 8,000 inhabitants. The Dutch were still able to practice their own religion under British rule.</p>
<h2 id=where-did-the-dutch-settle-in-new-amsterdam>Where did the Dutch settle in New Amsterdam?</h2>
<p>On Governors Island, they built a fort, a windmill and likely other structures as well. But they quickly outgrew it, and by 1626 had founded New Amsterdam on the southern tip of nearby Manhattan Island.</p>
<h2 id=why-did-the-dutch-go-to-the-new-world>Why did the Dutch go to the New World?</h2>
<p>The Netherlands began financially supporting explorations to enhance their trading power. As a result, the Dutch East India Company (VOC) was established in 1602 with the intention of creating colonies for trading purposes. The purpose for the Dutch to go to the New World was to establish more trading options for the Netherlands.</p>
