<h2 id=how-dirty-is-the-ganges-river-in-india>How dirty is the Ganges River in India?</h2>
<p>Experts estimate that more than 3000 million litres of untreated sewage from these towns along the Ganges are pumped into the river every day. By the time it reaches Varanasi, whose untreated sewage (or most of it) is also pumped into the waters, it becomes a sewer and the sixth most polluted river in the world.</p>
<h2 id=is-the-ganges-the-dirtiest-river-in-the-world>Is the Ganges the dirtiest river in the world?</h2>
<p>The Ganga River, known as the Ganges under British rule, is one of the most revered waterways in the world, and also one of the most polluted. It provides water for nearly half-a-billion people, more than any other river in the world, stretching from the foothills of the Himalayas to the Bay of Bengal.</p>
<h2 id=where-is-the-main-source-of-the-ganges-river>Where is the main source of the Ganges River?</h2>
<p>Gomukh<br>
The Ganges River originates in the Himalaya Mountains at Gomukh, the terminus of the Gongotri Glacier. When the ice of this glacier melts, it forms the clear waters of the Bhagirathi River. As the Bhagirathi River flows down the Himalayas, it joins the Alaknanda River, officially forming the Ganges River.</p>
<h2 id=how-many-people-are-affected-by-pollution-of-the-ganges-river>How many people are affected by pollution of the Ganges River?</h2>
<p>Severely polluted with human waste and industrial contaminants, the river provides water to about 40% of India’s population across 11 states, serving an estimated population of 500 million people or more, more than any other river in the world.</p>
<h2 id=which-is-the-most-polluted-river-in-india>Which is the most polluted river in India?</h2>
<p>Water pollution is at its worst in India. The Ganges River, a holy river that was once pure Himalayan Mountain water has turned into a slimy monstrosity. If we were to look at any other river in the world, the Ganges would be the most polluted by quite the margin. Let’s take a look into the Ganges water.</p>
<h2 id=where-does-the-ganges-river-flow-in-india>Where does the Ganges river flow in India?</h2>
<p>The pollution and its causes have been dissected ad nauseam. Yet it is filthier than ever. The Ganges flows for 2500 kilometres from the Himalayas through four states where 400 million Indians live through to the east coast where it empties into the Bay of Bengal.</p>
<h2 id=how-much-waste-water-is-dumped-into-the-ganga-river>How much waste water is dumped into the Ganga river?</h2>
<p>Each day, 2.9 billion liters of waste water from sewage, domestic and industrial sources is dumped directly into the river, posing a serious public health crisis to over 500 million in the Ganga River Basin.</p>
