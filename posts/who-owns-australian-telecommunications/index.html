<h2 id=is-agl-australian-owned>Is AGL Australian owned?</h2>
<p>AGL was established in 1837 and currently has over 1.9 million residential customers – it is a publicly owned entity, which means it is partially Australian owned.</p>
<h2 id=is-telstra-the-worst-company-in-australia>Is Telstra the worst company in Australia?</h2>
<p>Australia’s leading internet provider seems to lead in more ways than one. Telstra ranked worst or second worst in all categories. Telstra also scores the lowest for value for money (66); significantly lower than TPG (80), iiNet (78) and Optus/OptusNet (74).</p>
<h2 id=how-often-do-telstra-pay-dividends>How often do Telstra pay dividends?</h2>

Sign up for Telstra Corporation and we’ll email you the dividend information when they declare. Add Telstra Corporation to receive free notifications when they declare their dividends.</p>
<h2 id=does-the-government-own-telstra>Does the government own Telstra?</h2>
<p>Telstra ownership, management As of today, Telstra is no longer owned by the government. The telco has over a million shareholders – it is the most widely held company on the ASX.</p>
<h2 id=does-telstra-own-all-phone-lines>Does Telstra own all phone lines?</h2>
<p>Telstra owns the copper-wire network that connects most of Australia’s homes. Telstra will still be able to use the lines, but it will be on the same basis as any other business that resells phone and internet services to people. Telstra will still own the lines inside the NBN wireless and satellite areas.</p>
<h2 id=is-agl-cheaper-than-origin>Is AGL cheaper than origin?</h2>
<p>AGL vs Origin: Who’s cheapest? Origin holds much cheaper rates than AGL in South Australia, according to our price estimates on this page. However, AGL works out slightly cheaper than Origin in Victoria and South East Queensland, while both providers offer the same prices in NSW.</p>
<h2 id=who-is-the-cheapest-energy-provider-in-australia>Who is the cheapest energy provider in Australia?</h2>
<p>Compare cheapest electricity company VIC. Compare cheapest electricity QLD….Compare cheapest electricity NSW.</p>
<table><tr><th>Energy provider</th><th>Mojo Power</th></tr><tr><td>Plan name</td><td>ReAmped Advance</td></tr><tr><td>% off the reference price</td><td>29% discount</td></tr><tr><td>Estimated annual cost</td><td>$994 / year</td></tr><tr><td>Energy provider</td><td>Alinta Energy</td></tr></table>
<h2 id=why-is-telstra-hated>Why is Telstra hated?</h2>
<p>Everyone in Australia’s internet industries hates Telstra, ranging from quiet passive-aggressive fury to spit-the-dummy, foaming-at-the-mouth passion, quietly blaming Telstra for the fact Australia is basically an internet backwater, importing far more data than it exports, a balance of trade that can be directly tied …</p>
<h2 id=how-much-of-telstra-is-owned-by-the-government>How much of Telstra is owned by the government?</h2>
<p>In 1999, a further 16% of Telstra shares were sold to the public, leaving the Australian government with 51% ownership. In 2006, T3 was announced by the government and was the largest of the three public releases, reducing the government’s ownership of Telstra to 17%. [6]</p>
<h2 id=why-is-telstra-limiting-internet-speeds-in-australia>Why is Telstra limiting Internet speeds in Australia?</h2>
<p>No, Telstra is not limiting internet speeds deliberately. Quite the opposite. The reason Australia has expensive internet services is that there is a government owned monopoly – the NBN – over fixed line consumer broadband services. Once the NBN appears in some area, it has to be used by law.</p>
<h2 id=who-is-the-ceo-of-telstra-in-australia>Who is the CEO of Telstra in Australia?</h2>
<p>Member, UNICEF Task Force on Workplace Gender Discrimination and Harassment (from 2018) and UNSW Business School Advisory Council (from 2005). Chief Executive Officer and Managing Director since 1 May 2015. Andy Penn became the CEO and Managing Director of Telstra, Australia’s largest telecommunications company, on 1 May 2015.</p>
<h2 id=how-much-landmass-does-telstra-cover-in-australia>How much landmass does Telstra cover in Australia?</h2>
<p>Here Telstra doesn’t give figures, but a quick glance at Telstra’s 4G coverage maps gives a visual indication of what’s reasonably available. Telstra’s clearly all but nailed the population coverage issue, but in terms of overall landmass, it is maybe covering 1/10th of Australia, if that.</p>
