<h2 id=what-did-the-colonies-want-from-britain>What did the colonies want from Britain?</h2>
<p>The Colonists wanted independence from Great Britain because the king created unreasonable taxes, those taxes were created because Britain just fought the French and Indians. England decided that since they fought on American soil, then it was only fair to make Colonists pay for it.</p>
<h2 id=what-colonies-did-britain-gain>What colonies did Britain gain?</h2>
<p>By 1670 there were British American colonies in New England, Virginia, and Maryland and settlements in the Bermudas, Honduras, Antigua, Barbados, and Nova Scotia. Jamaica was obtained by conquest in 1655, and the Hudson’s Bay Company established itself in what became northwestern Canada from the 1670s on.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-the-colonies-benefit-from-great-britain>How did the colonies benefit from Great Britain?</h2>
<p>Having colonies helped England in a few main ways: It gave them a safety valve for excess population. England could get raw materials from the colonies as well as things like rum that could be better prodcued in the colonies. They could sell finished goods to the colonists.</p>
<h2 id=what-five-things-did-the-colonists-want-from-britain>What five things did the colonists want from Britain?</h2>
<p>Among the natural rights of the Colonists are these: First, a right to life; Secondly, to liberty; Thirdly, to property; together with the right to support and defend them in the best manner they can.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-the-colonists-gain-independence-from-britain>How did the colonists gain independence from Britain?</h2>
<p>The American colonists gained their independence from Britain after a long struggle. At first, the colonists began to peacefully protest laws and policies they felt were unfair. These included policies over taxation and expansion to western lands.</p>
<h2 id=when-did-the-british-take-over-the-thirteen-colonies>When did the British take over the Thirteen Colonies?</h2>
<p>The thirteen colonies were the first British overseas acquisitions. There are 13 states located in North America that were the founding states of the United States of America. The states were under British rule from 1607 to 1776.</p>
<h2 id=why-did-the-british-restrict-trade-with-the-colonies>Why did the British restrict trade with the colonies?</h2>
<p>Trade was restricted so the colonies had to rely on Britain for imported goods and supplies. The King and Parliament believed they had the right to tax the colonies. They decided to require several kinds of taxes from the colonists to help pay for the French and Indian War. Hereof, what goods were traded in the British Empire?</p>
<h2 id=how-many-former-british-colonies-are-there-in-the-world>How many former British colonies are there in the world?</h2>
<p>There are at least 100 former British colonies all over the world. They include the United States of America, Canada, Kenya, Uganda, and Zanzibar.</p>
