<h2 id=what-is-the-colorado-river-story>What is the Colorado River story?</h2>
<p>From its genesis on the Continental Divide in Colorado’s Rocky Mountain National Park, the river originally known as the Grand grows from a cold mountain trout stream into a classic Western waterway slicing through jagged gorges between sweeping, pastoral ranchlands on the upper leg of a 1,450-mile journey.</p>
<h2 id=is-the-colorado-river-in-danger>Is the Colorado River in danger?</h2>
<p>A warmer watershed, a shrinking river. Scientists have found that the Colorado River is sensitive to rising temperatures as the planet heats up with the burning of fossil fuels. In other research, scientists estimated the river could lose roughly one-fourth of its flow by 2050 as temperatures continue to rise.</p>
<h2 id=can-you-swim-in-colorado-river-moab>Can you swim in Colorado River Moab?</h2>
<p>In those conditions, a simply swim in a cold creek can be as satisfying as any of those parks’ amazing landmarks. The Colorado River around Moab is swift and silty, so instead bathe in the refreshing waters of Mill Creek. Once you descend to the creek, the hiking is over and it’s time to swim.</p>
<h2 id=how-many-people-are-reliant-on-colorado-river>How many people are reliant on Colorado River?</h2>
<p>Between irrigation for crops and drinking water, 35-40 million are reliant on the Colorado River for water. With 29 dams, aqueducts and channels the Colorado is used for so much more than just recreation. 4. It is Home to Many Water Sports</p>
<h2 id=why-was-the-colorado-river-called-the-red-river>Why was the Colorado River called the Red River?</h2>
<p>It is now one of the most highly controlled rivers in the world. The Colorado River was known as the Red River due to the particles of silt carried in its waters. However, after the Glen Canyon Dam was built in 1963, the colored silt was trapped behind the dam and the river stopped looking red.</p>
<h2 id=where-does-the-colorado-river-get-its-water>Where does the Colorado River get its water?</h2>
<p>Its source in La Poudre Pass in Rocky Mountains, and it flows into the Sea of Cortez at the Gulf of California, between the Mexican states, Baja California and Sonora. The Colorado River supplies water to more than 25 million people.</p>
<h2 id=what-do-people-do-on-the-colorado-river>What do people do on the Colorado River?</h2>
<p>The diversity of the river changing from wide and slow moving to narrow with rapids allows for many types of recreational activities. White water rafting and kayaking are popular in the more narrow regions such as Fisher Towers, Westwater Canyon, Cataract Canyon and of course the Grand Canyon.</p>
