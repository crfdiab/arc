<h2 id=where-did-vasco-da-gama-discover>Where did Vasco da Gama discover?</h2>
<p>Vasco da Gama was best known for being the first to sail from Europe to India by rounding Africa’s Cape of Good Hope. Over the course of two voyages, beginning in 1497 and 1502, da Gama landed and traded in locales along the coast of southern Africa before reaching India on May 20, 1498.</p>
<h2 id=what-discoveries-did-vasco-da-gama-discover>What discoveries did Vasco da Gama discover?</h2>
<p>Da Gama’s discovery of the sea route to India opened the way for an age of global imperialism and enabled the Portuguese to establish a long-lasting colonial empire in Asia.</p>
<h2 id=what-did-vasco-da-gama-discover-1497>What did Vasco da Gama Discover 1497?</h2>
<p>In 1497, explorer Vasco da Gama was commissioned by the Portuguese king to find a maritime route to the East. His success in doing so proved to be one of the more instrumental moments in the history of navigation. He subsequently made two other voyages to India and was appointed as Portuguese viceroy in India in 1524.</p>

<p>Vasco da Gama sailed south and east and found what the others were looking for. It was on 20 th May 1498 Portuguese sailor Vasco da Gama set foot on the west coast of India. The arrival of Portuguese in India encouraged many other European countries to sail eastwards. India soon became a market for the western countries.</p>
<h2 id=where-can-i-find-the-1898-vasco-da-gama-stamp>Where can I find the 1898 Vasco da Gama stamp?</h2>
<p>The 1898 Vasco da Gama issue naturally is found in Portuguese India. The stamp comes with the value 1½ Portuguese Indian real and it depicts the discovery voyage to India. The stamp was issued on the 400 th anniversary of Vasco da Gama’s discovery of the route to India.</p>
<h2 id=what-did-francisco-da-gama-do-for-portugal>What did Francisco da Gama do for Portugal?</h2>
<p>When Da Gama arrived at Lisbon about three weeks later, the Portuguese gave him a hero’s welcome. The king awarded him the grand title, ‘Lord of the Conquest, Navigation and Commerce of Ethiopia, Arabia, Persia and India’, and ‘Admiral of the Indian Sea’, with the rank of Dom, and many other rewards.</p>
<h2 id=when-did-vasco-da-gama-reach-st-helena>When did Vasco da Gama reach St Helena?</h2>
<p>Vasco’s brother, Paulo, captained the Sao Raphael. For almost four months they sailed across the Atlantic without sight of land until, on *4 November 1497, they reached a bay (current day St Helena).</p>
