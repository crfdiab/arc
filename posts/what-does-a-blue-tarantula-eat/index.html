<h2 id=what-does-a-blue-tarantula-eat>What does a blue tarantula eat?</h2>
<p>Cobalt Blues will eat well on a few live crickets, cockroaches, or other large insects a week. Other things they like to eat are mealworms and baby mice. Remove any dead or uneaten food with tongs. Tarantulas molt when they grow larger, so if you see your spider on its back it’s probably molting.</p>
<h2 id=is-a-cobalt-blue-tarantula-a-new-world>Is a cobalt blue tarantula a new world?</h2>
<p>The Cobalt Blue Spider (Haplopelma lividum) is a tarantula species that is native to Myanmar and Thailand. The Cobalt Blue Spider is also an obligate burrower and generally very shy. As with all Old World spiders they do not possess urticating hairs, so rely more on biting for defence.</p>
<h2 id=is-a-tarantula-a-carnivore>Is a tarantula a carnivore?</h2>
<p>Tarantulas are carnivores, meaning that they feed on meat. They eat many kinds of large insects such as crickets, grasshoppers, June beetles, cicadas, millipedes, caterpillars, and other spiders. Larger tarantulas will also eat frogs, toads, fish, lizards, bats, and even small rodents and snakes.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-a-cobalt-blue-tarantula-predators>What is a cobalt blue tarantula predators?</h2>
<p>The animals that eat these animal species and others are known as predators. The predators of these Cobalt blue tarantulas include spider-eating birds, wasps, snakes, and lizards. They are also used for the exotic pet trade purposes. Their population is declining because of many reasons; habitat loss is one of them.</p>
<h2 id=can-a-cobalt-blue-tarantula-kill-you>Can a cobalt blue tarantula kill you?</h2>
<p>Although the bite of the cobalt blue can be extremely painful, its venom is generally not considered dangerous to humans. Tarantulas, like most arachnid species, have adapted to killing for food, so the strength and amount of their venom is toxic only to their prey.</p>

<h2 id=do-tarantulas-like-being-handled>Do tarantulas like being handled?</h2>
<p>Answer: Tarantulas are furry eight-legged creatures that are about four inches in length. Generally, tarantulas respond to daily handling. They crawl freely when placed on an arm or shoulder, but they definitely are not a pet that an owner can cuddle. Tarantulas are very timid and bite only when provoked.</p>
<h2 id=what-kind-of-insect-will-eat-a-tarantula>What kind of insect will eat a tarantula?</h2>
<p>Tarantulas have few natural enemies, but parasitic pepsis wasps are a formidable exception. Such a wasp will paralyze a tarantula with its sting and lay its eggs on the spider’s body. When the eggs hatch, wasp larvae gorge themselves on the still living tarantula.</p>
<h2 id=what-kind-of-habitat-does-a-tarantula-live-in>What kind of habitat does a tarantula live in?</h2>
<p>Habitat There are hundreds of tarantula species found in most of the world’s tropical, subtropical, and arid regions. They vary in color and behavior according to their specific environments. Generally, however, tarantulas are burrowers that live in the ground.</p>
<h2 id=how-does-a-tarantula-become-a-popular-pet>How does a tarantula become a popular pet?</h2>
<p>Among arachnid enthusiasts, these spiders have become popular pets. Tarantulas periodically shed their external skeletons in a process called molting. In the process, they also replace internal organs, such as female genitalia and stomach lining, and even regrow lost appendages.</p>
<h2 id=what-kind-of-web-does-a-tarantula-use>What kind of web does a tarantula use?</h2>
<p>A tarantula doesn’t use a web to ensnare prey, though it may spin a trip wire to signal an alert when something approaches its burrow. These spiders grab with their appendages, inject paralyzing venom, and dispatch their unfortunate victims with their fangs.</p>
