<p>If the tightness of the head is not uniform, the tone of the drum will change depending on where the drum is struck, and it will be a muddy tone at that. Thus, the drum head must be tightened so as to produce the same tone when struck in different places.</p>

<h2 id=how-much-is-a-decent-drum-set>How much is a decent drum set?</h2>
<p>Generally, a drum set costs between $300 and $1,000 on average. Factors that determine price are often quality of shells, hardware inclusion, custom builds, if they are hand-made, different tiers of quality within the brand, and the number of shells. Used instruments often offer a great entry into the drumming world.</p>
