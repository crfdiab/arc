<h2 id=what-did-william-the-conqueror-do-for-law>What did William the Conqueror do for law?</h2>
<p>The laws introduced by William the Conqueror after his victory at Hastings in 1066, had an impact on everybody in England. These laws were introduced by William to control the English. Along with the building of castles and the Domesday Book, these laws were part of William’s way of controlling the English population.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-william-change-the-legal-system>How did William change the legal system?</h2>
<p>Although he kept much of the Saxon legal system in place, William did make a few important changes. ❖ He introduced some new laws, in order to maintain Norman power in England. ❖ He introduced new courts, which increased the power of Norman lords over their lands.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-the-normans-change-law-and-order-in-england>How did the Normans change law and order in England?</h2>
<p>The King started to take more control over law and order and wanted to ensure people were loyal to him. Punishments were harsher. William brought in the Forest laws which for- bade hunting in the King’s forests and the Murdrum Law which valued the life of a Norman above the live of anyone else.</p>

<p>The Norman Conquest</p>
<table><tr><th>Crime</th><th>Punishment</th></tr><tr><td>Stealing</td><td>Fine payable to the king Stocks or pillory Public beating or flogging</td></tr><tr><td>Slander</td><td>Tongue cut out</td></tr><tr><td>Repeat offences</td><td>Beating, maiming, hanging</td></tr><tr><td>Poaching, murder, rebellion</td><td>Execution- hanging or beheading</td></tr></table>
<h2 id=why-did-william-continue-to-use-the-english-language-in-laws>Why did William continue to use the English language in laws?</h2>
<p>Because King William believed he was the rightful successor to Edward the Confessor, his first written statements and proclamations were made in English, just like the kings before him.</p>

<p>Law and order in Norman England Because King William believed he was the rightful successor to Edward the Confessor, his first written statements and proclamations were made in English, just like the kings before him.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-william-keep-control-of-england-with-castles>How did William keep control of England with castles?</h2>
<p>William used the methods of control that he was most familiar with: castles and the feudal system. But he also adopted a new method in the form of the Domesday Book. From their castles, the new Norman lords could control the local area, and the sight of them made it clear who was now in control.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-william-take-long-term-control-of-england>How did William take long term control of England?</h2>
<p>The feudal system: William could not be everywhere at the same time. To solve this, he lent parcels of his new lands to nobles, or barons, as they were called at the time. In return for loyalty and taxes, they could use the land. The barons then loaned the land to knights who in turn loaned it to peasants who then did all of the hard farming work!</p>
<h2 id=who-was-the-king-of-england-in-1066>Who was the King of England in 1066?</h2>
<p>The Norman conquest of 1066 is one of the turning points in the legal history of the English common law. William the Conqueror, the Duke of Normandy successfully invaded and killed the then King of England, Harold II, and therefore, William became the King of England by the right of conquest.</p>
