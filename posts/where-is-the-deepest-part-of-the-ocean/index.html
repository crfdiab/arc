<h2 id=where-is-the-deepest-part-of-the-ocean>Where is the deepest part of the ocean?</h2>
<p>Pacific Ocean<br>
The Mariana Trench, in the Pacific Ocean, is the deepest location on Earth. According to the Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ), the United States has jurisdiction over the trench and its resources.</p>
<h2 id=has-anyone-been-to-bottom-of-mariana-trench>Has anyone been to bottom of Mariana Trench?</h2>
<p>On 23 January 1960, two explorers, US navy lieutenant Don Walsh and Swiss engineer Jacques Piccard, became the first people to dive 11km (seven miles) to the bottom of the Mariana Trench.</p>
<h2 id=have-we-reached-the-deepest-part-of-the-ocean>Have we reached the deepest part of the ocean?</h2>
<p>Explorer Victor Vescovo completes mission to dive to deepest points in the world’s oceans. Vescovo’s trip to the Challenger Deep, at the southern end of the Pacific Ocean’s Mariana Trench, back in May, was said to be the deepest manned sea dive ever recorded, at 10,927 meters (35,853 feet).</p>
<h2 id=does-the-ocean-have-a-bottom>Does the ocean have a bottom?</h2>
<p>The seabed (also known as the seafloor, sea floor, or ocean floor) is the bottom of the ocean. All floors of the ocean are known as ‘seabeds’.</p>
<h2 id=what-would-happen-to-a-human-at-the-bottom-of-the-ocean>What would happen to a human at the bottom of the ocean?</h2>
<p>The pressure from the water would push in on the person’s body, causing any space that’s filled with air to collapse. (The air would be compressed.) So, the lungs would collapse. At the same time, the pressure from the water would push water into the mouth, filling the lungs back up again with water instead of air.</p>
<h2 id=which-is-the-deepest-part-of-the-ocean>Which is the deepest part of the ocean?</h2>
<p>The Mariana Trench, situated in the western part of the Pacific Ocean, is considered to be the deepest point on Earth. It would actually be more precise to say that the Challenger Deep in the Mariana Trench is the deepest point on the surface of the Earth.</p>
<h2 id=which-is-the-most-hostile-part-of-the-ocean>Which is the most hostile part of the ocean?</h2>
<p>The deepest parts of the ocean are the most hostile habitats on the planet. The sunlight can’t reach the depths and the pressure at the bottom of the trench is the crushing 8 tons per square inch. Still, there are some though creatures that call this intimidating place home. Here are a top 10 of the most terrifying deep ocean creatures.</p>
<h2 id=how-many-people-have-reached-the-lowest-part-of-the-ocean>How many people have reached the lowest part of the ocean?</h2>
<p>Thousands have climbed Mount Everest, and a handful of people have walked on the moon. But reaching the lowest part of the ocean? Only three people have ever done that, and one was a U.S. Navy submariner.</p>
<h2 id=which-is-the-easternmost-ocean-in-the-world>Which is the easternmost Ocean in the world?</h2>
<p>These seas include East China, Philippine Sea, East Sea, South China Sea, Tasman Sea, and the Sulu Sea. The Torres Strait and Strait of Malacca interconnect the Pacific and the Indian Ocean to the west. On the east, the Strait of Magellan and the Drake Passage join the Pacific Ocean and the Atlantic Ocean.</p>
