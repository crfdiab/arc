<h2 id=what-is-an-explanation-based-on-scientific-knowledge>What is an explanation based on scientific knowledge?</h2>
<p>A scientific theory is an explanation of things or events based on knowledge gained from many observations and investigations.</p>
<h2 id=what-makes-a-good-scientific-knowledge>What makes a good scientific knowledge?</h2>
<p>It is derived from perception, learning, and discovery. Scientific knowledge, in particular, is organized in a systematic way and is testable and verifiable. It is used to provide explanations of the occurrence of events (Mayr, 1982, p. 23).</p>
<h2 id=what-is-an-example-of-scientific-knowledge>What is an example of scientific knowledge?</h2>
<p>This is the easy part – scientific knowledge is ‘what you know’. For instance, you might understand how and why the water cycle works, what part of a soundwave indicates how loud it is (hint: it’s the height!), how plants use the energy from sunlight to make their food on sunlight, and so on.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-science-of-human-knowledge>What is the science of human knowledge?</h2>
<p>The study of the human sciences attempts to expand and enlighten the human being’s knowledge of their existence, its interrelationship with other species and systems, and the development of artifacts to perpetuate the human expression and thought. It is the study of human phenomena.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-main-difference-between-a-scientific-law-and-a-theory>What is the main difference between a scientific law and a theory?</h2>
<p>What Is a Scientific Law? Like theories, scientific laws describe phenomena that the scientific community has found to be provably true. Generally, laws describe what will happen in a given situation as demonstrable by a mathematical equation, whereas theories describe how the phenomenon happens.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-4-areas-of-human-knowledge-that-support-technology>What are 4 areas of human knowledge that support technology?</h2>
<p>The best four components of knowledge management are people, process, content/IT, and strategy.</p>
<h2 id=what-distinguishes-science-from-other-areas-of-knowledge>What distinguishes science from other areas of knowledge?</h2>
<p>Unlike art, philosophy, religion and other ways of knowing, science is based on empirical research. Research results are considered reliable when other scientists can perform the same experiment under the same conditions and obtain the same or similar results. …</p>
<h2 id=what-are-the-4-types-of-knowledge>What are the 4 types of knowledge?</h2>
<p>During this progression, four types of knowledge are developed: declarative, procedural, contextual, and somatic.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-the-7-characteristics-of-scientific-knowledge>What are the 7 characteristics of scientific knowledge?</h2>
<p>Top 9 Main Characteristics of Science – Explained!</p>
<ul>
<li>Objectivity:</li>
<li>Verifiability:</li>
<li>Ethical Neutrality:</li>
<li>Systematic Exploration:</li>
<li>Reliability:</li>
<li>Precision:</li>
<li>Accuracy:</li>
<li>Abstractness:</li>
</ul>
<h2 id=what-are-the-4-categories-of-human-knowledge>What are the 4 categories of human knowledge?</h2>
<p>On the basis of a detailed task analysis we distin- guished four types of knowledge: situational knowledge, conceptual knowledge, procedural knowledge, and strategic knowledge.</p>
<h2 id=which-is-an-example-of-a-scientific-fact>Which is an example of a scientific fact?</h2>
<p>Scientific knowledge includes truths that apply to everyone. Since these truths can be proved experimentally, scientific knowledge is generally accepted. Under normal conditions, for example, water boils at 100 degrees around the world.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-the-characteristics-of-a-scientific-knowledge>What are the characteristics of a scientific knowledge?</h2>
<p>Characteristics of scientific knowledge and concrete What is scientific knowledge? Scientific knowledge is the set of verifiable knowledge given by certain thanks to the steps contemplated in the scientific method. That is, those knowledge obtained through the rigorous, methodical and verifiable study of the phenomena of nature.</p>
<h2 id=how-is-science-a-process-for-learning-about-the-world>How is science a process for learning about the world?</h2>
<p>Science is a process for learning about the world, which involves collecting data through scientific research, the collecting of data to investigate and explain a phenomenon, and following processes to reduce bias. The result of the scientific research is scientific knowledge – the things we learned from the scientific process.</p>
<h2 id=which-is-a-characteristic-of-the-accumulation-of-knowledge>Which is a characteristic of the accumulation of knowledge?</h2>
<p>Accumulation: Science is a dynamic process; regularly shows improvement and renewal on previous scientific studies and scientific theories. As a result, scientific knowledge is dynamic and can be developed and renewed.</p>
