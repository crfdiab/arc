<h2 id=who-blew-up-the-uss-maine>Who blew up the U.S.S. Maine?</h2>
<p>Ostensibly on a friendly visit, the Maine had been sent to Cuba to protect the interests of Americans there after a rebellion against Spanish rule broke out in Havana in January. An official U.S. Naval Court of Inquiry ruled in March that the ship was blown up by a mine, without directly placing the blame on Spain.</p>

<p>She exploded and sank on the evening of 15 February 1898, killing three-quarters of her crew. In 1898, a U.S. Navy board of inquiry ruled that the ship had been sunk by an external explosion from a mine….USS Maine (1889)</p>

<h2 id=why-did-the-us-blamed-spain-for-the-sinking-of-uss-maine>Why did the US blamed Spain for the sinking of U.S.S. Maine?</h2>
<p>Many people in the United States blamed Spain (Today, however, many historians believe a malfunction in the ship caused the explosion). The relationship between Spain and the U.S. became so strained that they could no longer discuss the situation. By the end of April, the Spanish-American War had begun.</p>

<p>Even if this identification were made, the Americans could still have blamed the Spanish authorities for failing to adequately police the harbor and provide security for the visiting warship. On the other hand, the Cuban rebels were the one group which had the most to gain from such an incident.</p>
<h2 id=where-was-the-uss-maine-when-it-exploded>Where was the USS Maine when it exploded?</h2>
<p>A massive explosion of unknown origin sinks the battleship USS Maine in Cuba’s Havana harbor on February 15, 1898, killing 260 of the fewer than 400 American crew members aboard. One of the first American battleships, the Maine weighed more than 6,000 tons and was built at a cost of more than $2 million.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-cause-of-the-sinking-of-the-battleship-maine>What was the cause of the sinking of the battleship Maine?</h2>
<p>At 9.40pm on the night of 15 February 1898 the United States battleship Maine, riding quietly at anchor in Havana harbour, was suddenly blown up, apparently by a mine, in an explosion which tore her bottom out and sank her, killing 260 officers and men on board.</p>
<h2 id=why-was-the-uss-maine-blown-up-in-cuba>Why was the USS Maine blown up in Cuba?</h2>
<p>The United States battleship was blown up in an explosion during Cuba’s uprising against Spain. What caused the explosion and who was responsible?</p>
