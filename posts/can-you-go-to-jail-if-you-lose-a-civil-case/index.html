<h2 id=can-you-go-to-jail-if-you-lose-a-civil-case>Can you go to jail if you lose a civil case?</h2>
<p>In civil court, one person sues (files a case) against another person because of a dispute or problem between them. If someone loses a case in civil court, that person may be ordered to pay money to the other side or return property, but that person does not go to jail just for losing the case.</p>
<h2 id=does-a-defendant-have-to-testify-in-civil-cases>Does a defendant have to testify in civil cases?</h2>
<p>The simple answer is no, you never have to go on the witness stand if you have been charged with a criminal offence and are going to court. But if you are a defendant in court, you have a right to silence and cannot be forced to testify on the witness stand.</p>
<h2 id=how-can-i-protect-my-assets-from-a-civil-lawsuit>How can I protect my assets from a civil lawsuit?</h2>

</ol>
<h2 id=why-are-most-civil-cases-settled-before-they-go-to-trial>Why are most civil cases settled before they go to trial?</h2>
<p>In the majority of civil lawsuits, the defendant settles with the plaintiff because it is more economical to do so. The plaintiff will also have to sign an agreement to not pursue any further litigation, so there won’t be additional losses in the future. In a trial, the defendant may prevail.</p>

<h2 id=who-bears-the-burden-of-proof>Who bears the burden of proof?</h2>
<p>the plaintiff<br>
In a civil lawsuit, the burden of proof rests on the plaintiff or the person filing the suit. The plaintiff should prove that the allegations are true and that the defendant, or the other party, caused damages. When it comes to establishing a civil case, the plaintiff must usually do so by a preponderance of evidence.</p>
<h2 id=who-bares-the-burden-of-proof>Who bares the burden of proof?</h2>
<p>In civil cases, the plaintiff has the burden of proving his case by a preponderance of the evidence. A “preponderance of the evidence” and “beyond a reasonable doubt” are different standards, requiring different amounts of proof.</p>
<h2 id=what-happens-if-i-fail-to-appear-in-court-for-a-civil-case>What happens if I fail to appear in court for a civil case?</h2>
<p>This will prevent you from filing another case against the defendant for the same cause. If you are the defendant in a civil case and you fail to appear in court, the judge can decide the case in the plaintiff’s favor and enter a judgment against you for the full amount of the suit, plus any court costs and attorney fees.</p>
<h2 id=do-you-need-a-grand-jury-indictment-in-ga>Do you need a grand jury indictment in Ga?</h2>
<p>Georgia only requires grand jury indictments for capital crimes where the death sentence is a possible outcome. Accusations and informations are used for lesser crimes. An arraignment is where you appear before the trial court, are advised of the charges against you, and are asked to enter your plea to those charges.</p>
<h2 id=what-happens-when-a-person-misses-their-court-date-in-georgia>What happens when a person misses their court date in Georgia?</h2>
<p>For traffic citations in Georgia, O.C.G.A. § 17-6-11 details that if a person fails to appear for court, the clerk of court must notify the accused by mail of their failure to appear before issuing a bench warrant. This notice will allow the accused 30 days to dispose of their charges or waive arraignment and plead not guilty.</p>
<h2 id=what-happens-if-the-plaintiff-does-not-show-up-for-the-trial>What happens if the plaintiff does not show up for the trial?</h2>
<p>If the Plaintiff fails to appear for the trial and the Defendant appear and has filed a counterclaim, the Judge may enter a default judgment against the Plaintiff based on the Defendant’s counterclaim, assuming the Defendant satisfied all the requirements for a default judgment.
