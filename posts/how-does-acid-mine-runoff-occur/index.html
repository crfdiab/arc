<h2 id=how-does-acid-mine-runoff-occur>How does acid mine runoff occur?</h2>
<p>Acid mine drainage is the formation and movement of highly acidic water rich in heavy metals. This acidic water forms through the chemical reaction of surface water (rainwater, snowmelt, pond water) and shallow subsurface water with rocks that contain sulfur-bearing minerals, resulting in sulfuric acid.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-root-cause-of-acid-mine-drainage>What is the root cause of acid mine drainage?</h2>
<p>Mine drainage is formed when pyrite (an iron sulfide) is exposed and reacts with air and water to form sulfuric acid and dissolved iron. The acid runoff further dissolves heavy metals such as copper, lead, and mercury into groundwater or surface water.</p>
<h2 id=how-does-acid-mine-drainage-affect-the-environment>How does acid mine drainage affect the environment?</h2>
<p>Environmental and Human Impacts If mining waste is acid-generating, the impacts to fish, animals and plants can be severe. The most immediate and serious impacts of acid mine drainage are on natural waterways. High levels of dissolved metals may kill off all of the resident fish and aquatic life.</p>
<h2 id=can-acid-mine-drainage-be-remediated>Can acid mine drainage be remediated?</h2>
<p>Some common methods include: Reclamation of contaminated land by (1) adding lime or other alkaline materials to neutralize the acidity, and (2) adding uncontaminated top soil, planting vegetation, and modifying slopes to stabilize the soil and reduce infiltration of surface water into underlying contaminated material.</p>
<h2 id=how-do-you-identify-acid-mine-drainage>How do you identify acid mine drainage?</h2>
<p>Acid drainage is often marked by “yellow boy,” an orange-yellow substance (visible in the photo on this page) that occurs when the pH of acidic mine-influenced water raises above pH 3 (approaching more neutral conditions), so that the previously dissolved iron precipitates out.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-ph-of-acid-mine-drainage>What is the pH of acid mine drainage?</h2>
<p>The pH of AMD is usually in the range of 2–6, but mine-impacted waters at circumneutral pH (5–8) are also common….Abstract.</p>

<h2 id=what-is-the-root-cause-of-acid-mine-drainage-quizlet>What is the root cause of acid mine drainage quizlet?</h2>
<p>Mine contains metal sulphide that react to form sulphuric acid solution with dissolved metals. After mining started, the rain exposed the sulphide and caused the drainage to contaminate the water, sediments, and ground water.</p>
<h2 id=where-is-acid-mine-drainage-a-problem>Where is acid mine drainage a problem?</h2>
<p>Acid Mine Drainage (AMD) is currently the main pollutant of surface water in the mid-Atlantic region. AMD is caused when water flows over or through sulfur-bearing materials forming solutions of net acidity. AMD comes mainly from abandoned coal mines and currently active mining.</p>
<h2 id=how-are-humans-affected-by-acid-mine-drainage>How are humans affected by acid mine drainage?</h2>
<p>Because of concentration levels, AMD can be 20 to 300 times more acidic than acid rain and can burn human skin and kill fish and other aquatic life. AMD also leaches toxic metals, including arsenic, cadmium, chromium, and lead from waste rock which can cause further pollution.</p>
<h2 id=how-can-we-prevent-acid-mine-drainage>How can we prevent acid mine drainage?</h2>
<p>The most effective method to minimize penetration of air and water through the waste pile is to use a cover, either wet (water) or dry (soil) which is placed over the waste pile. Despite their high cost, these covers cannot always completely stop the oxidation process and generation of AMD.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-acid-drainage-and-where-does-it-come-from-in-a-mining-context>What is acid drainage and where does it come from in a mining context?</h2>
<p>In a nutshell, acid mine drainage is a form of water pollution that happens when rain, runoff, or streams come in contact with rock that is rich in sulfur. Other harmful elements like lead, copper, arsenic, or mercury may also be stripped from the rocks by the acidic water, further contaminating the stream.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-the-two-main-types-of-mineral-extraction>What are the two main types of mineral extraction?</h2>
<p>There are several different ways minerals can be extracted from the earth, but the two main methods are called surface mining and subsurface mining.</p>
