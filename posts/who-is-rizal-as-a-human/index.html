<h2 id=who-is-rizal-as-a-human>Who is Rizal as a human?</h2>
<p>Besides being the national hero of the Philippines, Jose Rizal was also known through time as the First Filipino, Pride of the Malayan Race, the Greatest Malayan, among others. Many considered him a genius, a master of all trades, a patriot, a model brother and an ideal son.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-jose-rizal-considered-as>What is Jose Rizal considered as?</h2>
<p>José Rizal (1861-1896) is one of the most revered figures in Philippine history. He was a multifaceted intellectual and a political activist, best known for his political writings that inspired the Philippine revolution and ultimately led to his execution by the Spanish colonizers.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-jose-rizal-influence-humanity>How did Jose Rizal influence humanity?</h2>
<p>Rizal was the first to give the name Filipino, in writing, to the people of the Philippines. Before then, it applied only to Spaniards who lived in the archipelago; the natives were called Indios. In first championing nationalism in Asia, Rizal became the pioneering exponent in Asia of the universal rights of man.</p>
<h2 id=is-it-true-that-jose-rizal-was-a-human-being>Is it true that Jose Rizal was a human being?</h2>
<p>It’s a simple fact we tend to gloss over when studying our nation’s history: Jose Rizal is very, very human.</p>
<h2 id=how-old-was-jose-protasio-rizal-when-he-died>How old was Jose Protasio Rizal when he died?</h2>
<p>José Protasio Rizal Mercado y Alonso Realonda (Spanish pronunciation: [xoˈse riˈsal]; June 19, 1861 – December 30, 1896) was a Filipino nationalist and polymath during the tail end of the Spanish colonial period of the Philippines.</p>
<h2 id=what-did-ocampo-say-about-jose-rizal>What did Ocampo say about Jose Rizal?</h2>
<p>He compared Rizal to other ‘heroes’, he showed who Rizal is on a daily basis and he defended that Rizal, the Filipino hero, is just a normal person just like the rest of us. Ocampo was appealing to the mass.</p>
<h2 id=why-was-jose-rizal-the-father-of-philippine-comics>Why was Jose Rizal the father of Philippine comics?</h2>
<p>Rizal is regarded by many as the “Father of Philippine Comics” because of some humorous illustrations he made in Germany. The said drawing, entitled “The baptism of two brothers” (see photo above), was inspired by the German cartoon “Max and Moritz.” Rizal made it to entertain the children of his landlord, Pastor Ulmer.</p>
