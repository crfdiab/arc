<p>On Christmas Eve, instead of filling stockings with treats and small gifts, Pere Noel, the French equivalent of Father Christmas and Santa Claus fills their shoes, which are laid near the hearth.</p>

<p>Saint Nicholas Day<br>
In the United States, one custom associated with Saint Nicholas Day is children leaving their shoes in the foyer on Saint Nicholas Eve in hope that Saint Nicholas will place some coins on the soles. The American Santa Claus, as well as the British Father Christmas, derive from Saint Nicholas.</p>

<h2 id=whats-the-tradition-of-throwing-shoes-on-christmas-day>What’s the tradition of throwing shoes on Christmas Day?</h2>
<p>There is one particular tradition that’s reserved for Christmas Day though and that’s the shoe toss. Probably more of a superstition, it’s said that if you throw a shoe over your shoulder on Christmas Day and the toe points towards the door, you’ll get married soon! St Nicholas and Shoes</p>
<h2 id=where-does-the-tradition-of-putting-presents-in-shoes-come-from>Where does the tradition of putting presents in shoes come from?</h2>
<p>They’re told that during the night, Sinterklaas will travel along the roofs on his white horse and a Black Peter will climb down the chimney (or through a window) and put the presents in their shoes. Much like in the Netherlands, many Czech Christmas traditions centre around St. Nicholas Day too, with Christmas itself a much quieter affair.</p>
<h2 id=whats-the-tradition-of-leaving-shoes-for-st-nicholas>What’s the tradition of leaving shoes for St Nicholas?</h2>
<p>St. Nicholas’ feast day traditions vary widely from country to country, but they all carry the same theme of small gifts and treats left in either shoes or stockings. Continuing this Advent tradition in your own home is a great way to teach your children to venerate the saints and to deepen their knowledge of and love for the Christian faith.</p>
<h2 id=what-do-people-in-some-countries-do-for-christmas>What do people in some countries do for Christmas?</h2>
<p>Well, that’s what tradition calls for in some countries. Here are Christmas celebrations that can’t be found in the US: You know how people hate being single on the holidays? Well, single Czech women are no different. On Christmas Eve, it’s tradition for Czech women to put their backs to the house door and throw a shoe over their shoulders.</p>
