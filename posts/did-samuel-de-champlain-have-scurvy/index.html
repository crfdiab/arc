<h2 id=did-samuel-de-champlain-have-scurvy>Did Samuel de Champlain have scurvy?</h2>
<p>But few of us have known winters as bad as those of Samuel de Champlain. The winter of 1604-05 was spent at Sainte-Croix. The winter proved more dangerous than the Spanish; 16 of Champlain’s 25 men died of scurvy or dysentery over those frigid months.</p>
<h2 id=did-samuel-de-champlain-do-bad-things>Did Samuel de Champlain do bad things?</h2>
<p>Samuel de Champlain is the worst because… He went through many wars and battles with tribes, and other people just to find what he had discovered on his journeys. Then when they found land, he instantly sent his starving crew into war.</p>
<h2 id=what-happened-when-samuel-de-champlain-discover>What happened when Samuel de Champlain discover?</h2>
<p>He was key to French expansion in the New World. Known as the “Father of New France,” Champlain founded Quebec (1608), one of the oldest cities in what is now Canada, and consolidated French colonies. He also made important explorations of what is now northern New York, the Ottawa River, and the eastern Great Lakes.</p>
<h2 id=when-did-samuel-de-champlain-get-scurvy>When did Samuel de Champlain get scurvy?</h2>
<p>Analysis of 20 European colonists buried at Saint Croix Island in New France during the winter of 1604–1605, accompanied by their leader Samuel de Champlain’s eyewitness account of their symptoms, provided the opportunity to document lesions of adult scurvy within a tightly dated historical context.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-winter-like-for-samuel-de-champlain>What was the winter like for Samuel de Champlain?</h2>
<p>It was extremely cold, unlike anything Champlain or his men had seen in France, and scurvy ravaged their ranks. The severe temperatures exacerbated the weariness, sore limbs and swollen, bleeding gums brought on by a lack of vitamin C. The following winter was just as bad, and once again scurvy was a factor.</p>
<h2 id=who-was-samuel-de-champlain-and-what-did-he-do>Who was Samuel de Champlain and what did he do?</h2>
<p>See Article History. Samuel de Champlain, (born 1567, Brouage, France—died December 25, 1635, Quebec, New France [now in Quebec, Canada]), French explorer, acknowledged founder of the city of Quebec (1608), and consolidator of the French colonies in the New World.</p>
<h2 id=why-did-sailors-get-scurvy-in-new-france>Why did sailors get scurvy in New France?</h2>
<p>Scurvy, long the scourge of sailors, results from a prolonged deficiency of dietary ascorbic acid (the reduced form of vitamin C) or the inability to metabolize adequate amounts of the vitamin.</p>
