<h2 id=what-latitudes-are-most-favorable-for-a-tornado>What latitudes are most favorable for a tornado?</h2>
<p>Globally, the middle latitudes, between about 30° and 50° North or South, provide the most favorable environment for tornadogenesis. This is the region where cold, polar air meets against warmer, subtropical air, often generating convective precipitation along the collision boundaries.</p>
<h2 id=where-is-the-best-place-to-be-during-a-tornado-strike>Where is the best place to be during a tornado strike?</h2>
<p>Although there is no completely safe place during a tornado, some locations are much safer than others. Go to the basement or an inside room without windows on the lowest floor (bathroom, closet, center hallway). If possible, avoid sheltering in a room with windows.</p>
<h2 id=where-was-the-tornado-at-in-lasalle-il>Where was the tornado at in LaSalle IL?</h2>
<p>AT 658 PM MDT, A SEVERE THUNDERSTORM WAS LOCATED NEAR LASALLE, OR 7 MILES SOUTH OF GREELEY, MOVING NORTH AT 10 MPH. AT 855 PM EDT, SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS WERE LOCATED ALONG A LINE EXTENDING FROM NEAR COPPER HILL TO DUBLIN, MOVING SOUTH AT 40 MPH.</p>
<h2 id=why-are-tornado-warnings-delayed-for-so-long>Why are tornado warnings delayed for so long?</h2>
<p>Warnings are delayed. If you are currently affected by severe storms, you should also be paying attention to a local source of information (tv, radio, etc), or have a weather radio, because information on this site can be delayed enough that it could cause you to lose valuable lead time. The map sometimes breaks in odd ways.</p>
<h2 id=when-is-the-last-update-on-the-tornado-tracker>When is the last update on the tornado tracker?</h2>
<p>You are on the experimental live-updating severe weather page. If you experience problems, you can use the regular versions of the tornado tracker and severe weather tracker maps. Read more about the gotchas. Last updated at 6:02 PM.</p>
<h2 id=where-are-severe-thunderstorms-located-in-new-orleans>Where are severe thunderstorms located in New Orleans?</h2>
<p>AT 855 PM EDT, SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS WERE LOCATED ALONG A LINE EXTENDING FROM NEAR COPPER HILL TO DUBLIN, MOVING SOUTH AT 40 MPH. AT 755 PM CDT, STRONG THUNDERSTORMS WERE LOCATED ALONG A LINE EXTENDING FROM 17 NM NORTHWEST OF TERREBONNE BAY TO 11 NM NORTHWEST OF LOUISIANA OFFSHORE OIL PORT, MOVING SOUTH AT 10 KNOTS.</p>
