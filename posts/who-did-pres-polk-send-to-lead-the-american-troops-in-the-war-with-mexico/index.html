<h2 id=who-did-pres-polk-send-to-lead-the-american-troops-in-the-war-with-mexico>Who did Pres Polk send to lead the American troops in the war with Mexico?</h2>
<p>James K. Polk sent John Slidell on a secret mission to Mexico City to negotiate the disputed Texas border, settle U.S. claims against Mexico, and purchase New Mexico and California for up to $30 million.</p>
<h2 id=what-did-president-polk-do-that-led-to-war-with-mexico>What did President Polk do that led to war with Mexico?</h2>
<p>On May 12, 1846, the United States Senate voted 40 to 2 to go to war with Mexico. President James K. Polk had accused Mexican troops of having attacked Americans on U.S. soil, north of the Rio Grande. But Mexico claimed this land as its own territory and accused the American military of having invaded.</p>
<h2 id=who-was-the-general-that-led-the-troops-in-the-war-with-mexico>Who was the general that led the troops in the war with Mexico?</h2>
<p>During the Mexican-American War, U.S. forces under General Winfield Scott enter Mexico City and raise the American flag over the Hall of Montezuma, concluding a devastating advance that began with an amphibious landing at Vera Cruz six months earlier.</p>
<h2 id=why-wasnt-the-mexican-american-war-justified>Why wasn’t the Mexican American war justified?</h2>
<p>The US was unjustified because the US wanted slaves and Mexico denied slaves and did not want them around. The reasons the US was unjustified because of Polk provoked it, Robbery, and slavery growing. Since Polk believed in Manifest Destiny he wanted America to grow, so he stole Texas, and had slaves.</p>
<h2 id=when-did-president-polk-declare-war-on-mexico>When did President Polk declare war on Mexico?</h2>
<p>Polk, in turn, declared the Mexican advance to be an invasion of U.S. soil, and on May 11, 1846, asked Congress to declare war on Mexico, which it did two days later. After nearly two years of fighting, peace was established by the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo, signed on February 2, 1848.</p>
<h2 id=what-did-polk-do-to-expand-the-nation>What did Polk do to expand the nation?</h2>

<h2 id=why-did-the-united-states-declare-war-on-mexico-in-1846>Why did the United States declare war on Mexico in 1846?</h2>
<p>U.S. Congress declares war on Mexico. On May 13, 1846, the U.S. Congress overwhelmingly votes in favor of President James K. Polk’s request to declare war on Mexico in a dispute over Texas. Under the threat of war, theUnited States had refrained from annexing Texas after the latter won independence from Mexico in 1836.</p>
<h2 id=who-was-the-us-general-at-the-mouth-of-the-rio-grande>Who was the US General at the mouth of the Rio Grande?</h2>
<p>After the mission failed, the U.S. army under Gen. Zachary Taylor advanced to the mouth of the Rio Grande, the river that the state of Texas claimed as its southern boundary.</p>
