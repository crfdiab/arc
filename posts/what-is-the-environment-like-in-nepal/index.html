<h2 id=what-is-the-environment-like-in-nepal>What is the environment like in Nepal?</h2>
<p>Nepal’s climate, influenced by elevation as well as by its location in a subtropical latitude, ranges from subtropical monsoon conditions in the Tarai, through a warm temperate climate between 4,000 and 7,000 feet in the mid-mountain region, to cool temperate conditions in the higher parts of mountains between 7,000 …</p>
<h2 id=how-is-nepal-addressing-the-issue-of-climate-change>How is Nepal addressing the issue of climate change?</h2>
<p>Climate Change Policy Nepal’s Climate Change Policy (2011) envisions a country spared from the adverse impacts of climate change, by considering climate justice, through the pursuit of environmental conservation, human development, and sustainable development – all contributing toward a prosperous society.</p>
<h2 id=which-of-the-following-factors-is-the-most-dominant-factor-to-affect-the-climate-of-nepal>Which of the following factors is the most dominant factor to affect the climate of Nepal?</h2>
<p>The major factor that affects the climate of Nepal is an altitude.</p>

<h2 id=which-is-the-hottest-city-in-nepal>Which is the hottest city in Nepal?</h2>
<p>Nepalgunj<br>
The highest temperature ever recorded in Nepalgunj was 45.0 °C (113.0 °F) on 16 June 1995, while the lowest temperature ever recorded was −0.3 °C (31.5 °F) on 9 January 2013.</p>
<h2 id=what-symptoms-has-climate-change-been-noticed-in-nepal>What symptoms has climate change been noticed in Nepal?</h2>
<p>Millions of Nepalese are estimated to be at risk from the impacts of climate change including reductions in agricultural production, food insecurity, strained water resources, loss of forests and biodiversity, as well as damaged infrastructure.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-main-cause-of-climate-change-in-nepal>What is the main cause of climate change in Nepal?</h2>
<p>Climate change may be caused by both natural and anthropogenic forcing, but at present time unsustainable anthropogenic activities and enormous greenhouse gases (GHGs) emissions are causing erratic climate change. Lack of adequate fund for adaptation makes Nepal and its people very vulnerable to climate change.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-national-adaptation-plan-of-action-for-nepal>What is the National Adaptation Plan of action for Nepal?</h2>
<p>Nepal’s National Adaptation Plan of Action (NAPA) prepared in 2010 also recognizes that climate will be uncertain and vulnerability will increase. Climate-related disasters can broadly be caused by rapid-onset events and slow-onset events.</p>
<h2 id=how-is-nepal-a-land-of-climate-diversity>How is Nepal a land of climate diversity?</h2>
<p>Nepal: Land of climate diversity. Despite its relatively small area, Nepal has very diverse climatic conditions, ranging from tropical in the south to alpine in the north. The country’s three distinct geographies-the snow covered mountains, the mid hills and the tarai (plains)-embodies this diversity.</p>
<h2 id=how-do-people-adapt-to-their-new-environment>How do people adapt to their new environment?</h2>
<p>Some adaptations take place over the course of generations of individuals. The adaptation occurs as the mutated genome is diffused throughout the population. Other adaptations take place fairly quickly. When a person moves to a region with very high altitude, their body must acclimate to the smaller amount…</p>
<h2 id=how-is-forest-cover-being-improved-in-nepal>How is forest cover being improved in Nepal?</h2>
<p>Nepal’s forest cover, condition and quality are being improved. This is the success of only through three way partnership such as communities from bottom-up function, government & donor from top-down function and NGOs, civil society network from outside-in.</p>
