<h2 id=is-mexico-different-from-united-states>Is Mexico different from United States?</h2>
<p>Cultural Differences between Mexico, the USA and Canada. Although the three countries that make up North America are physically close, Mexico is simply a different country than her northern neighbors. Mexico has a different history and a different culture. Mexicans have their own ways of doing and looking at things.</p>
<h2 id=how-is-the-united-states-of-america-a-democratic-country>How is the United States of America a democratic country?</h2>
<p>The United States is a representative democracy. This means that our government is elected by citizens. Here, citizens vote for their government officials. Voting in an election and contacting our elected officials are two ways that Americans can participate in their democracy.</p>
<h2 id=when-did-the-pri-lose-power-in-mexico>When did the PRI lose power in Mexico?</h2>
<p>A number of factors, including the 1994 economic crisis in Mexico, caused the PRI to lose its absolute majority in both chambers of the federal congress for the first time in 1997. After several decades in power the PRI had become a symbol of corruption and electoral fraud.</p>
<h2 id=whats-the-difference-between-the-united-states-and-mexico>What’s the difference between the United States and Mexico?</h2>
<p>The government in United States is also Federal presidential constitutional republic. • According to the statistics of 2014 GDP, United States is in the first place while Mexico is in the 15th place. • When it comes to tourist destinations or countries mostly visited, United States is ahead of Mexico.</p>
<h2 id=how-is-america-different-from-other-democracies>How is America different from other democracies?</h2>
<p>In most of the rest of the democratic world, people simply pay taxes to fund their health care, which is largely subsidized by the government, and administered through a system of state run or regulated providers – and called “socialized medicine” by critics. [ See a collection of political cartoons on Obamacare.]</p>
<h2 id=how-many-members-of-congress-does-mexico-have>How many members of Congress does Mexico have?</h2>
<p>The US Congress has 100 senators (two for each state) and 435 representatives. The Mexican Congress has 128 senadores and 500 diputados. In the Mexican Congress, senators and representatives are barred from immediate reelection, though they can return for a later term and stand for reelection. In the US, there is no limit to reelection.</p>
<h2 id=what-makes-mexico-different-from-the-rest-of-the-world>What makes Mexico different from the rest of the world?</h2>
<p>Mexico has a different history and a different culture. Mexicans have their own ways of doing and looking at things. Each Mexican’s beliefs, expectations and codes of personal and social conduct are so different as to be from a different world.</p>
