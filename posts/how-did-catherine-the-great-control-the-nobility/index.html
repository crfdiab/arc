<h2 id=how-did-catherine-the-great-control-the-nobility>How did Catherine the Great control the nobility?</h2>
<p>Catherine realised her heavy reliance on the nobility to control the country and instigated a series of reforms giving them greater control over their land and serfs. The 1785 ‘Charter to the Nobility’ established them as a separate estate in Russian society and assured their privileges.</p>
<h2 id=was-catherine-an-enlightened-ruler-explain-why-or-why-not>Was Catherine an enlightened ruler explain why or why not?</h2>
<p>Catherine the Great was indeed an enlightened despot. She used the ideals of the Enlightenment in order to increase the power and security of Russia. By being a leader who led Russia into peace and prosperity, Catherine might make her detractors think that she is deserving of the title of Empress after all.</p>
<h2 id=what-did-catherine-of-aragon-do-to-the-peasants>What did Catherine of Aragon do to the peasants?</h2>
<p>Catherine confirmed the authority of the nobles over the serfs in return for the nobles’ political cooperation.This was one of the chief reasons behind ongoing rebellions. The unrest intensified as the 18th century wore on, with more than fifty peasant revolts occurring between 1762 and 1769.</p>
<h2 id=when-did-the-rule-of-catherine-i-end>When did the rule of Catherine I end?</h2>
<p>It began with the rule of Catherine I in 1725, and ended with the short rule of Peter III in 1762. Peter changed the rules of succession to the throne after the death of his son Aleksey, who had opposed his father’s reforms and served as a rallying figure for anti-reform groups.</p>
<h2 id=how-many-serfs-did-alexander-the-great-free>How many serfs did Alexander the Great free?</h2>
<p>In Russia, there were serfs owned by private citizens and serfs owned by the state. Alexander first freed the private serfs. They were 23 million people. Five years later, he freed the state’s serfs: 23 more million people.</p>
<h2 id=what-did-a-noble-do-to-his-serfs>What did a noble do to his serfs?</h2>
<p>The only thing a noble could not do to his serfs was to kill them. The life of a serf belonged to the state. Historically, when the serfs faced problems they could not solve (such as abusive masters), they appealed to the autocrat.</p>
