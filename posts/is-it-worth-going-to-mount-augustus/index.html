<h2 id=is-it-worth-going-to-mount-augustus>Is it worth going to Mount Augustus?</h2>
<p>Despite its remoteness, Mount Augustus in Western Australia is an incredible place to visit and well worth the drive and effort in getting there. The best time to visit is from June to September.</p>
<h2 id=why-is-mount-augustus-so-significant>Why is Mount Augustus so significant?</h2>
<p>Mount Augustus is a monocline: a type of rock formation that leans, or ‘dips’ in a single direction. At 1700 million years old, it is three times older than Uluru and twice its size, making it the largest rock in the world – and today, you’re going to climb its peak.</p>
<h2 id=can-you-swim-at-mount-augustus>Can you swim at Mount Augustus?</h2>
<p>Mount Augustus is the world’s biggest rock – but amazingly, many Australians have never heard of it. It is located within Mount Augustus National Park, a lush outback paradise with swimming holes, ancient rock art, a small but buzzing tourist park and the cutest outback bar you’ve ever seen.</p>
<h2 id=do-you-need-a-4wd-to-get-to-mount-augustus>Do you need a 4wd to get to Mount Augustus?</h2>
<p>Access. Mount Augustus is 430 km from Carnarvon via Gascoyne Junction and 360 km from Meekatharra. Roads are gravel but suitable for two wheel drive vehicles. Roads may be closed or substantially damaged after heavy rain.</p>
<h2 id=is-mount-augustus-bigger-than-uluru>Is Mount Augustus bigger than Uluru?</h2>
<p>Rising 717m above the flat plains which surround it, Mount Augustus covers an area of 4,795 hectares, making it one-and-a-half times larger than Uluru (3,330 hectares). It has a central ridge, almost eight kilometres long, and it is estimated to be more than 1,600 million years old.</p>

<h2 id=what-is-the-biggest-rock-on-earth>What is the biggest rock on earth?</h2>
<p>Uluru<br>
The defining difference between the two formations is their designation as a monolith. Uluru is the world’s largest single rock monolith. That is to say, there is no other single rock formation as large as Uluru. Mount Augustus, on the other hand, contains a variety of rock types.</p>
<h2 id=which-is-the-best-place-to-visit-in-western-australia>Which is the best place to visit in Western Australia?</h2>
<p>With a national park dedicated to the great space in which Mt. Augustus resides, it is one of the greatest spots in Western Australia. Rich with heritage and untouched beauty, Mt. Augustus is a place of discovery and adventure that is bound to reveal something about you and your limits.</p>
<h2 id=where-is-the-biggest-rock-in-western-australia>Where is the biggest rock in Western Australia?</h2>
<p>Found roughly 1,000 kilometres north of Perth in the Gascoyne Murchison region of Western Australia, Mount Augustus is the world’s biggest rock – but amazingly, many Australians have never heard of it.</p>
<h2 id=where-is-the-walga-rock-in-western-australia>Where is the Walga Rock in Western Australia?</h2>
<p>A huge granite monolith known as Walga Rock is situated 48 kilometres west of Cue and is a site of deep cultural and spiritual significance. The rock offers spectacular views of the area, unusual rock formations and a time preserved gallery of Aboriginal Art. Start a #roadtrip today and follow the Miners Pathway.</p>
