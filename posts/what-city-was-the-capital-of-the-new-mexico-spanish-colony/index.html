<p>Santa Fe<br>
After New Mexico was ceded to the United States (1848), Santa Fe became the capital in 1851 of the Territory of New Mexico and, in 1912, of the state. In 1862 the city was occupied for two weeks by Confederate forces under General H.H. Sibley.</p>
<h2 id=what-happened-in-new-mexico-in-1598>What happened in New Mexico in 1598?</h2>
<p>In 1598, New Mexico became an official colony of Spain. The first capital was San Juan de los Caballeros. The Spanish built Catholic missions throughout the region where priests taught the Native Americans about their religion. In 1680, a Pueblo leader named Popé led the Pueblo in a revolt against the Spanish.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-capital-of-new-mexico-called-in-1609>What was the capital of New Mexico called in 1609?</h2>
<p>In 1609, Pedro de Peralta was made governor of the “Kingdom and Provinces of New Mexico,” and a year later he founded its capital at Santa Fe.</p>
<h2 id=where-was-the-first-capital-of-new-mexico>Where was the first capital of New Mexico?</h2>
<p>Today New Mexico considers this to be the first American Thanksgiving. The expedition settles at the juncture of the Rio Grande and the Chama River and establishes “San Juan de los Caballeros” as the first capital of New Mexico.</p>
<h2 id=who-was-the-first-person-to-settle-in-new-mexico>Who was the first person to settle in New Mexico?</h2>
<p>Don Juan de Oñate, an American-born Spaniard, founded the first permanent European settlement in New Mexico that year. Under Oñate’s leadership, Spanish colonists established the first European capital of New Mexico at San Juan de los Caballeros, at the former site of a pueblo called Caypa.</p>

<p>But then, seemingly just in the knick-of-time, they located a Spanish slaving expedition and their ticket to rest and provisions. King Philip II (Felipe II) of Spain called for the exploration and colonization missions led by Francisco de Ibarra and Juan de Oñate in the latter half of the sixteenth century.</p>
<h2 id=who-was-the-spanish-governor-of-new-mexico>Who was the Spanish Governor of New Mexico?</h2>
<p>Settled in 1599, San Gabriel was the second European capital of New Mexico and seat of Governor O ate, the first European governor of New Mexico. King Philip II of Spain chose O ate to represent Spanish and Roman Catholic interests in the new colony.</p>
