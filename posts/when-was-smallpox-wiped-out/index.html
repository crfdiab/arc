<h2 id=when-was-smallpox-wiped-out>When was smallpox wiped out?</h2>
<p>World Free of Smallpox Almost two centuries after Jenner hoped that vaccination could annihilate smallpox, the 33rd World Health Assembly declared the world free of this disease on May 8, 1980. Many people consider smallpox eradication to be the biggest achievement in international public health.</p>
<h2 id=who-eradicated-smallpox>Who eradicated smallpox?</h2>
<p>In 1796 Edward Jenner introduced the modern smallpox vaccine. In 1967, the WHO intensified efforts to eliminate the disease. Smallpox is one of two infectious diseases to have been eradicated, the other being rinderpest in 2011….Cause.</p>
<table><tr><th>Variola virus</th></tr><tr><td>Genus:</td><td>Orthopoxvirus</td></tr><tr><td>Species:</td><td>†Variola virus</td></tr></table>
<h2 id=was-there-a-smallpox-in-australia>Was there a smallpox in Australia?</h2>
<p>Around 1829, smallpox erupted in central New South Wales. Mair’s report therefore demonstrates that the earlier outbreak was true smallpox. Extracts from Mair’s report have been available since 1919. They were published by the Australian government in John Cumpston’s History of Small-Pox in Australia.</p>
<h2 id=what-diseases-did-convicts-bring-to-australia>What diseases did convicts bring to Australia?</h2>
<p>The major epidemic diseases during the early contact stage were smallpox, syphilis, tuberculosis, influenza, and measles. Each of these diseases were responsible for excessive morbidity and mortality.</p>
<h2 id=is-smallpox-still-around-today>Is smallpox still around today?</h2>
<p>Currently, there is no evidence of naturally occurring smallpox transmission anywhere in the world. Although a worldwide immunization program eradicated smallpox disease decades ago, small quantities of smallpox virus officially still exist in two research laboratories in Atlanta, Georgia, and in Russia.</p>
<h2 id=what-diseases-were-brought-to-australia>What diseases were brought to Australia?</h2>
<p>The spread of smallpox was followed by influenza, measles, tuberculosis and sexually transmitted diseases, all of which Australia’s Aboriginal people had no resistance to, and all of which brought widespread death.</p>
<h2 id=when-was-the-last-smallpox-pandemic>When was the last smallpox pandemic?</h2>
<p>Smallpox Virus Thanks to the success of vaccination, the last natural outbreak of smallpox in the United States occurred in 1949. In 1980, the World Health Assembly declared smallpox eradicated (eliminated), and no cases of naturally occurring smallpox have happened since.</p>
<h2 id=can-you-be-naturally-immune-to-smallpox>Can you be naturally immune to smallpox?</h2>
<p>Just because you were exposed to smallpox does not mean that you were necessarily exposed and infected. The only way that one becomes immune to the disease is by natural disease (development of rash) and by successful vaccination, although the vaccination does not provide life-long immunity.</p>
