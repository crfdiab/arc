<h2 id=what-did-reconstruction-do-for-the-south>What did Reconstruction do for the South?</h2>
<p>Among the other achievements of Reconstruction were the South’s first state-funded public school systems, more equitable taxation legislation, laws against racial discrimination in public transport and accommodations and ambitious economic development programs (including aid to railroads and other enterprises).</p>
<h2 id=what-were-southern-states-placed-under-during-reconstruction>What were southern states placed under during Reconstruction?</h2>
<p>As Confederate states came back under control of the U.S. Army, President Abraham Lincoln set up reconstructed governments in Tennessee, Arkansas, and Louisiana during the war. A restored government of Virginia operated since 1861 in parts of Virginia, and also acted to create the new state of West Virginia.</p>
<h2 id=why-did-reconstruction-fail-in-the-south>Why did reconstruction fail in the South?</h2>
<p>Reconstruction was a significant chapter in the history of civil rights in the United States, but most historians consider it a failure because the South became a poverty-stricken backwater attached to agriculture.</p>
<h2 id=why-was-the-14th-amendment-not-successful>Why was the 14th Amendment not successful?</h2>
<p>By this definition, the framers of the Fourteenth Amendment failed, because though African Americans were granted the legal rights to act as full citizens, they could not do so without fear for their lives and those of their family.</p>
<h2 id=when-did-reconstruction-begin-and-end-in-georgia>When did reconstruction begin and end in Georgia?</h2>
<p>As a defeated Confederate state, Georgia underwent Reconstruction from 1865, when the Civil War (1861-65) ended, until 1871, when Republican government and military occupation in the state ended. Though relatively brief, Reconstruction transformed the state politically, socially, and economically.</p>
<h2 id=what-did-reconstruction-do-to-the-south-after-the-civil-war>What did reconstruction do to the south after the Civil War?</h2>
<p>Reconstruction (1865-1877), the turbulent era following the Civil War, was the effort to reintegrate Southern states from the Confederacy and 4 million newly-freed slaves into the United States. Under the administration of President Andrew Johnson in 1865 and 1866, new southern state legislatures passed restrictive “black codes” to control …</p>
<h2 id=are-there-public-schools-in-the-south-after-reconstruction>Are there public schools in the south after Reconstruction?</h2>
<p>Public schools had been established by Reconstruction legislatures for the first time in most Southern states. The schools for black children were consistently underfunded compared to schools for white children, even when considered within the strained finances of the postwar South.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-cash-crop-in-georgia-during-reconstruction>What was the cash crop in Georgia during Reconstruction?</h2>
<p>Georgia during Reconstruction. The state’s chief cash crop, cotton, fell from a high of more than 700,000 bales in 1860 to less than 50,000 in 1865, while harvests of corn and wheat were also meager. The state government subsidized construction of numerous new railroad lines. White farmers turned to cotton as a cash crop,…</p>
