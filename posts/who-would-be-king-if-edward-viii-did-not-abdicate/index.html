<p>His younger brother Bertie became King George VI and was the father of the present Queen Elizabeth II. He died in 1952, and Edward who had no children died in 1972. So even if Edward had not abdicated Elizabeth would now be Queen.</p>

<p>Edward VIII abdicates<br>
After ruling for less than one year, Edward VIII becomes the first English monarch to voluntarily abdicate the throne. He chose to abdicate after the British government, public, and the Church of England condemned his decision to marry the American divorcée Wallis Warfield Simpson.</p>
<h2 id=when-did-wallis-simpson-die-and-of-what>When did Wallis Simpson die and of what?</h2>
<p>24 April 1986<br>
Wallis Simpson/Date of death</p>
<p>Wallis Simpson, in full Wallis Warfield, duchess of Windsor née Bessie Wallis Warfield, also called (1916–27) Wallis Warfield Spencer, (born June 19, 1896, Blue Ridge Summit, Pennsylvania, U.S.—died April 24, 1986, Paris, France), American socialite who became the wife of Prince Edward, duke of Windsor (Edward VIII).</p>
<h2 id=are-the-duke-of-windsors-letters-real-in-the-crown>Are the Duke of Windsors Letters real in the crown?</h2>
<p>Yes … and no. The spiteful sentiments expressed in the letters, including the Duke’s scathing nicknames for his family, are accurate; the Duke and his wife would use code names for the Royals throughout their correspondence.</p>
<h2 id=did-the-queen-visit-her-uncle-in-paris>Did the Queen visit her uncle in Paris?</h2>
<p>Both Queen Elizabeth II and Prince Charles visited the Windsors in Paris in the Duke’s later years, the Queen’s visit coming only shortly before the Duke died.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-abdication-of-king-edward-ii>What was the abdication of King Edward II?</h2>
<p>“Abdication of Edward” redirects here. For the abdication of Edward II, see Parliament of 1327. In 1936 a constitutional crisis in the British Empire arose when King-Emperor Edward VIII proposed to marry Wallis Simpson, an American socialite who was divorced from her first husband and was pursuing the divorce of her second.</p>
<h2 id=why-did-the-king-of-england-abdicate-in-1936>Why did the King of England abdicate in 1936?</h2>
<p>Despite the opposition, Edward declared that he loved Simpson and intended to marry her as soon as her second divorce was finalised. The widespread unwillingness to accept Simpson as the King’s consort and Edward’s refusal to give her up led to his abdication in December 1936. He was succeeded by his brother Albert, who became George VI.</p>
<h2 id=when-was-the-last-time-a-king-abdicated-the-throne>When was the last time a king abdicated the throne?</h2>
<p>Most of the world’s monarchies and empires have experienced an abdication of the ruling king, queen or emperor at one time or another. The Roman Empire, which controlled much of the Mediterranean region for centuries, from 753 B.C. to the 5th century A.D., experienced several notable abdications, including that of Lucius Cornelius Sulla in 79 B.C.</p>
<h2 id=who-was-the-king-of-the-united-kingdom-in-1896>Who was the king of the United Kingdom in 1896?</h2>
<p>King Of The United Kingdom. Wallis Simpson, Previously Wallis Spencer, Later The Duchess Of Windsor, 1896 – 1986. American Socialite Whose Third Husband, Prince Edward, Duke Of Windsor, Formerly King Edward Viii, Abdicated His Throne To Marry Her. From Edward Viii His Life And Reign.</p>
