<h2 id=who-were-the-leaders-of-the-enlightenment-in-europe>Who were the leaders of the Enlightenment in Europe?</h2>
<p>Some of the major figures of the Enlightenment included Cesare Beccaria, Denis Diderot, David Hume, Immanuel Kant, Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz, John Locke, Montesquieu, Jean-Jacques Rousseau, Adam Smith, Hugo Grotius, Baruch Spinoza, and Voltaire.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-the-enlightenment-impact-government-and-rulers>How did the Enlightenment impact government and rulers?</h2>
<p>The Enlightenment brought political modernization to the west, in terms of focusing on democratic values and institutions and the creation of modern, liberal democracies. Enlightenment thinkers sought to curtail the political power of organized religion, and thereby prevent another age of intolerant religious war.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-the-enlightenment-impact-the-government>How did the Enlightenment impact the government?</h2>
<p>In turn, the Enlightenment ideals of liberty, equality, and justice helped to create the conditions for the American Revolution and the subsequent Constitution. Democracy was not created in a heartbeat. The American colonies began developing a democratic tradition during their earliest stages of development.</p>
<h2 id=what-did-the-rulers-of-the-age-of-enlightenment-do>What did the rulers of the Age of Enlightenment do?</h2>
<p>In short, the ideas of the Enlightenment thinkers were not fully realized during the Age of Enlightenment. However, the 18th-century monarchs did help to build a foundation for greater political and social freedom in the future. “Rulers of the Age of Enlightenment (Overview).” World History: The Modern Era. ABC-CLIO, 2012. Web. 3 Dec. 2012.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-impact-of-enlightenment-in-europe>What was the impact of Enlightenment in Europe?</h2>
<p>The Impact of Enlightenment in Europe b. The Great Awakening c. The Trial of John Peter Zenger d. Smuggling e. A Tradition of Rebellion f. “What Is the American?” 8. America’s Place in the Global Struggle a. New France b.</p>
<h2 id=who-was-a-philosopher-who-was-against-the-enlightenment>Who was a philosopher who was against the Enlightenment?</h2>
<p>Another contemporary philosopher of the Philosophs was Rousseau. He was against the Enlightenment and had different views about the origins of civilisation. In his view, civilisation was a curse, not a blessing for humans. He believed that sovereignty should belong to the people.</p>
<h2 id=what-did-catharine-the-great-want-to-do-with-voltaire>What did Catharine the great want to do with Voltaire?</h2>
<p>Catharine the Great corresponded with Voltaire, Diderot and other writers and encouraged them to continue their mission without any interruption. She invited Diderot to Russia and welcomed him warmly. The main motive of the Philosophs was to alter the character of absolute monarchy and foster enlightened and liberal rulers.</p>
