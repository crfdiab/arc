<h2 id=when-did-the-egyptian-empire-start-to-decline>When did the Egyptian empire start to decline?</h2>
<p>Conventional wisdom holds that Egypt’s Old Kingdom collapsed around 2150 B.C., soon after the death of pharaoh Pepi II, whose pyramid is now a pile of rubble.</p>
<h2 id=what-caused-egypts-decline>What caused Egypt’s decline?</h2>
<p>There were several factors that contributed to the decline of the Old Kingdom, but the most important issue was the erosion of the authority of the Pharaoh and the accompanying growing power of the nobility and priesthood. This led to the decentralization of power in Egypt and constant power struggles and civil war.</p>
<h2 id=why-did-the-civilization-of-egypt-decline-and-end>Why did the civilization of Egypt decline and end?</h2>
<p>The factors leading to the decline of ancient Egypt were largely uncontrollable. A civil war coupled with invasions by the Assyrians weakened the Egyptian military allowing the Persian empire to successfully invade and take over Egypt.</p>
<h2 id=who-was-one-of-the-most-important-goddesses-in-ancient-egyptian-religion>Who was one of the most important goddesses in ancient Egyptian religion?</h2>
<p>The origins of Isis are obscure. Unlike many gods, she can’t be tied to a specific town, and there are no certain mentions of her in the earliest Egyptian literature. Over time she grew in importance, though, eventually becoming the most important goddess in the pantheon.</p>

<p>The last vestiges of the ancient Egyptian belief system died out in the 4th Century AD, when Constantine made Christianity the only legal religion.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-ancient-egypt-go-into-an-age-of-decline>How did ancient Egypt go into an age of decline?</h2>
<p>After the rule of these kings, Egypt went into an age of decline . The country was attacked and conquered by various people, until finally, Egypt became part of the Roman Empire. Ramses II, also known as the Great, is one of the most talked about pharaohs of ancient Egypt.</p>

<p>Fragment of a Mining Papyrus Wars at the end of the Egyptian empire While the devastating civil war significantly influenced the health of the Egyptian state, other military conflictsfurther weakened the empire and eventually led to its total collapse. In approximately 671 BC the nearby Assyrians invaded Egypt and reigned until about 627 BC.</p>
<h2 id=when-did-the-dynastic-period-start-and-end-in-egypt>When did the dynastic period start and end in Egypt?</h2>
<p>This was the age of the pyramids, mummification and hieroglyphic writing. The dynastic period started with the reign of Egypt’s first king, Narmer, in approximately 3100 BCE, and ended with the death of Cleopatra VII in 30 BCE.</p>
<h2 id=when-did-the-ancient-egyptians-lose-to-the-persians>When did the ancient Egyptians lose to the Persians?</h2>
<p>In 609 BCE, the Egyptians attempted to save the Assyrians, who were losing their war with the Babylonians, Chaldeans, Medians, and Scythians. However, they were unsuccessful. In 525 BCE, the Persians, led by Cambyses II, invaded Egypt, capturing the Pharaoh Psamtik III.</p>
