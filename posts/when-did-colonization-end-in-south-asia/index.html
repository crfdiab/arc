<h2 id=when-did-colonization-end-in-south-asia>When did colonization end in South Asia?</h2>
<p>All colonized countries in Southeast Asia became independent by 1965.</p>
<h2 id=when-was-southeast-asia-colonized>When was Southeast Asia colonized?</h2>
<p>Over the course of the nineteenth century, Southeast Asia is colonized by Britain, France, and Holland. In 1799, the Dutch government takes over the Dutch East India Company’s rule of parts of the Indonesian archipelago.</p>
<h2 id=when-did-the-colonization-era-end>When did the colonization era end?</h2>
<p>Colonial America (1492-1763) European nations came to the Americas to increase their wealth and broaden their influence over world affairs.</p>
<h2 id=when-did-colonialism-start-in-asia>When did colonialism start in Asia?</h2>
<p>Between the 1870s and the beginning of World War I in 1914, the United Kingdom, France, and the Netherlands—the established colonial powers in Asia—added to their empires vast expanses of territory in the Middle East, the Indian Subcontinent, and Southeast Asia.</p>
<h2 id=why-did-the-british-lose-control-of-south-asia>Why did the British lose control of South Asia?</h2>
<p>Britain has to abandon much of its imperial project in the Middle East and South Asia because Soviet influence in the region is growing massively, and it settles for having a rearguard position in Africa as its primary colonial possession through the 1950s and 60s.</p>
<h2 id=when-did-colonialism-take-place-in-southeast-asia>When did colonialism take place in Southeast Asia?</h2>
<p>From the 1500s to the mid-1940s, colonialism was imposed over Southeast Asia. For hundreds of years, Southeast Asian kingdoms had been engaged in international commercial relations with traders from East Asia (China), South Asia (India), and West Asia (the “Middle East”).</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-role-of-imperialism-in-southeast-asia>What was the role of imperialism in Southeast Asia?</h2>
<p>Imperialism, Colonialism, and Nationalism in Southeast Asia. Great Britain, France, Spain, the Netherlands, and the United States were the imperialist countries that had colonies in Southeast Asia. Portugal also had a colony in the region but had the least impact.</p>
<h2 id=when-did-the-british-take-over-southeast-asia>When did the British take over Southeast Asia?</h2>
<p>By 1886 the rest of the region had been divided among the British, French, Dutch, and Spanish (who soon were replaced by the Americans), with the Portuguese still clinging to the island of Timor.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-crisis-in-southeast-asia-in-the-18th-century>What was the crisis in Southeast Asia in the 18th century?</h2>
<p>In the last half of the 18th century, all the major states of Southeast Asia were faced with crisis.</p>
