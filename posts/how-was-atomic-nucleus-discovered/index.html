<h2 id=how-was-atomic-nucleus-discovered>How was atomic nucleus discovered?</h2>
<p>In 1911, Rutherford, Marsden and Geiger discovered the dense atomic nucleus by bombarding a thin gold sheet with the alpha particles emitted by radium. From this observation, they concluded that almost all the atomic matter was concentrated in a tiny volume situated at the atome center, the atomic nucleus.</p>
<h2 id=what-experiment-did-rutherford-discover-the-nucleus>What experiment did Rutherford discover the nucleus?</h2>
<p>Rutherford’s gold foil experiment showed that the atom is mostly empty space with a tiny, dense, positively-charged nucleus. Based on these results, Rutherford proposed the nuclear model of the atom.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-hans-geiger-discover>How did Hans Geiger discover?</h2>
<p>The German physicist Hans Wilhelm Geiger is best known as the inventor of the Geiger counter to measure radiation. In 1908, Geiger introduced the first successful detector of individual alpha particles. Later versions of this counter were able to count beta particles and other ionizing radiation.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-geiger-and-marsden-discover-the-nucleus>How did Geiger and Marsden discover the nucleus?</h2>
<p>Experiments by Geiger and Marsden In 1904, J J Thomson proposed a new model for the atom. This model was tested by the scientists Geiger and Marsden in 1909. They set up a very thin layer of gold foil and fired alpha particles – radioactive particles with a positive charge – at the gold.</p>
<h2 id=who-discovered-nucleus--2-points>Who discovered nucleus * 2 points?</h2>
<p>Robert Brown discovered the nucleus in 1831. Hammerling in 1953 demonstrated that the nucleus is a storehouse of hereditary information with the help of grafting experimentations on Acetabularia. Further Reading: Nucleus – Structure and Function.</p>
<h2 id=who-discovered-nucleus-first>Who discovered nucleus first?</h2>
<p>Robert Brown<br>
-In 1831, Robert Brown discovered the cell nucleus. – He is mainly remembered for his descriptions of the cell nuclei and the continuous motion in the solution of minute particles called Brownian motion.</p>
<h2 id=where-did-hans-geiger-live>Where did Hans Geiger live?</h2>
<p>Germany<br>
Hans Geiger, byname of Johannes Wilhelm Geiger, (born September 30, 1882, Neustadt an der Haardt, Germany—died September 24, 1945, Potsdam), German physicist who introduced the first successful detector (the Geiger counter) of individual alpha particles and other ionizing radiations.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-hans-geiger-contribute-to-the-discovery-of-helium>How did Hans Geiger contribute to the discovery of helium?</h2>
<p>Hans Geiger. At Manchester, Geiger built the first version of his particle counter and used it and other radiation detectors in experiments that led to the identification of the alpha particle as the nucleus of the helium atom and to Rutherford’s correct proposal (1912) that, in any atom, the nucleus occupies a very small volume at the centre.</p>
<h2 id=what-did-hans-geiger-and-ernest-marsden-discover-about-the-atom>What did Hans Geiger and Ernest Marsden discover about the atom?</h2>
<p>…based on the experiments of Hans Geiger and Ernest Marsden, who in 1909 bombarded gold atoms with massive, fast-moving alpha particles; when some of these particles were deflected backward, Rutherford concluded that the atom has a massive, charged nucleus.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-hans-geiger-contribute-to-the-theory-of-quantum-mechanics>How did Hans Geiger contribute to the theory of quantum mechanics?</h2>
<p>quantum mechanics: Bohr’s theory of the atom. …based on the experiments of Hans Geiger and Ernest Marsden, who in 1909 bombarded gold atoms with massive, fast-moving alpha particles; when some of these particles were deflected backward, Rutherford concluded that the atom has a massive, charged nucleus.</p>
