<h2 id=how-did-the-french-revolution-affect-workers>How did the French Revolution affect workers?</h2>
<p>The Revolution destroyed the Old Order in France that determined every single person’s position and rights. Workers who had long been denied rights and privileges grew frustrated and angry that the higher classes would never be fair to them. They decided to challenge the ruling order to force change.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-the-people-benefit-from-the-french-revolution>How did the people benefit from the French Revolution?</h2>
<p>It established the precedent of representational, democratic government, now the model of governance in much of the world. It also established liberal social tenets of equality among all citizens, basic property rights, and separation of church and state, much as did the American Revolution.</p>
<h2 id=why-did-parisian-workers-revolt-in-1848>Why did Parisian workers revolt in 1848?</h2>
<p>The June Days uprising (French: les journées de Juin) was an uprising staged by French workers from 22 to 26 June 1848. It was in response to plans to close the National Workshops, created by the Second Republic in order to provide work and a minimal source of income for the unemployed.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-employment-and-the-revolution-of-1848-in-france>What was employment and the Revolution of 1848 in France?</h2>
<p>Employment and the Revolution of 1848 in France Employment and the Revolution of 1848 in France (1845-1852) Encouraged by expansion within the first and stage (1800-1850) of the first industrialization, the industrial and trading economy faced a strong growth in the years between 1840 and 1847: hence many jobs were created.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-result-of-the-revolution-in-france>What was the result of the revolution in France?</h2>
<p>The revolution was successful in France alone; the Second Republic and universal manhood suffrage were established, but the quarrel between the supporters of the république démocratique and the partisans of république démocratique et sociale culminated in a workers’ insurrection in June 1848.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-greatest-achievement-of-the-1848-revolution>What was the greatest achievement of the 1848 Revolution?</h2>
<p>The greatest achievement of the 1848 revolution for the colonies was the abolition of slavery. Slavery, the foundation of economic and social life in the vieilles colonies of Martinique, Guadeloupe, Guyane and Réunion, had been abolished by the Convention in 1794 but was reinstituted by Napoleon.</p>
<h2 id=what-did-the-national-guard-do-in-the-french-revolution>What did the National Guard do in the French Revolution?</h2>
<p>The National Guard arose as arbitrator between the army and the people. The 1848 Revolution in the History of France, sometimes known as the February Revolution ( révolution de Février ), was one of a wave of revolutions in 1848 in Europe.</p>
