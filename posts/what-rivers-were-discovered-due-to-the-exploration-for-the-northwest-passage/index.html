<p>Hudson and his crew sailed around Long Island and into New York’s Hudson River, but turned back when they realized it was not a through-channel. While Hudson didn’t discover the Northwest Passage, his voyage was the first step toward Dutch colonization of New York and the Hudson River area.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-result-of-europeans-searching-the-northwest-passage>What was the result of Europeans searching the Northwest Passage?</h2>
<p>What was the result of Europeans’ search for the Northwest Passage? The French and the Dutch instead discovered rivers and founded successful colonies.</p>
<h2 id=who-conquered-the-northwest-passage>Who conquered the Northwest Passage?</h2>
<p>explorer Roald Amundsen<br>
The first explorer to conquer the Northwest Passage solely by ship was the Norwegian explorer Roald Amundsen. In a three-year journey between 1903 and 1906, Amundsen explored the passage with a crew of six.</p>

<p>After unsuccessfully searching for a route above Norway, Hudson turned his ship west and sailed across the Atlantic. Hudson hoped to discover a “northwest passage,” that would allow a ship to cross the entirety of the North American continent and gain access to the Pacific Ocean, and from there, India.</p>
<h2 id=where-did-the-dutch-take-the-hudson-river-valley>Where did the Dutch take the Hudson River valley?</h2>
<p>Making his way as far as present-day Albany before the river became too shallow for his ship to continue north, Hudson returned to Europe and claimed the entire Hudson River Valley for his Dutch employers.</p>
<h2 id=where-did-henry-hudson-go-to-find-a-passage-to-india>Where did Henry Hudson go to find a passage to India?</h2>
<p>In 1609, two years after English settlers established the colony of Jamestown in Virginia, the Dutch East India Company hired English sailor Henry Hudson to find a northeast passage to India. After unsuccessfully searching for a route above Norway, Hudson turned his ship west and sailed across the Atlantic.</p>
<h2 id=where-did-the-dutch-settle-in-new-amsterdam>Where did the Dutch settle in New Amsterdam?</h2>
<p>Eventually, Stuyvesant cast his eyes upon the small settlements that had developed along the Hudson River Valley between Fort Orange and New Amsterdam. In 1652, 60-70 settlers had moved down from Fort Orange to an area where the Rondout Creek met the Hudson River, the site of present-day Kingston.</p>
