<h2 id=what-are-the-similarities-between-arctic-circle-and-antarctic-circle>What are the similarities between Arctic Circle and Antarctic Circle?</h2>
<p>Both poles are similar in temperature. Both the Arctic and Antarctic are solid ice, with snow on top. Antarctica is quite a small continent that nobody can visit. Humans cannot live in the Arctic.</p>
<h2 id=how-are-the-artic-and-antartic-similar>How are the Artic and Antartic similar?</h2>
<p>The Arctic is an ocean, covered by a thin layer of perennial sea ice and surrounded by land. (“Perennial” refers to the oldest and thickest sea ice.) Antarctica, on the other hand, is a continent, covered by a very thick ice cap and surrounded by a rim of sea ice and the Southern Ocean.</p>
<h2 id=what-do-the-arctic-circle-and-antarctic-circle-signify>What do the Arctic Circle and Antarctic Circle signify?</h2>
<p>Arctic Circle, parallel, or line of latitude around the Earth, at approximately 66°30′ N. The Antarctic Circle is the southern counterpart of the Arctic Circle, where on any given date conditions of daylight or darkness are exactly opposite.</p>
<h2 id=whats-the-difference-between-antarctica-and-the-arctic-circle>What’s the difference between Antarctica and the Arctic Circle?</h2>
<p>It is located in the south region of the Antarctic Circle. Geographically, it contains the South Pole and is enclosed by the southern ocean. On the other hand, Arctic contrasts Antarctica since it is situated on the farthest north region of the earth, particularly on the north of the Arctic Circle.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-tilt-of-the-arctic-circle>What is the tilt of the Arctic Circle?</h2>
<p>The tilt of the Earth is 23.5 degrees so with 90° subtracting 23.5° you get 66.5°. The Arctic Circle is 66.5 degrees north and the Antarctic Circle is 66.5 degrees south. …I thought the math would actually help….</p>
<h2 id=what-are-the-countries-in-the-arctic-circle>What are the countries in the Arctic Circle?</h2>
<p>That line is called the Arctic Circle. What countries are in the Arctic Circle? The Arctic Circle is made up of the Arctic Ocean and the North Pole, which is located in the centre of the circle. Parts of these countries can also be found in the Arctic Circle: Russia, Canada, Alaska (USA), Iceland, Finland, Sweden, Norway and Greenland.</p>
<h2 id=how-many-hours-of-daylight-does-the-arctic-circle-have>How many hours of Daylight does the Arctic Circle have?</h2>
<p>The same is true of the Antarctic Circle during the Southern Hemisphere winter. For everywhere within the Arctic Circle, there is at least twenty-four hours of continuous daylight on the Summer Solstice in June, and at least twenty-four hours of continuous nighttime on the Winter Solstice in December.</p>
