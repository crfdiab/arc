<h2 id=which-ocean-are-connected-by-the-bering-strait>Which ocean are connected by the Bering Strait?</h2>
<p>Pacific Ocean<br>
The Bering Strait: The Gateway to the Arctic Located between Alaska and Russia, the Bering Strait is the only marine gateway between the icy Arctic and the Pacific Ocean.</p>
<h2 id=what-hemisphere-is-bering-strait>What hemisphere is Bering Strait?</h2>
<p>The Bering Strait is a sea strait between Cape Dezhnev, Russia, the easternmost point (169 degrees 43′ W) of the Asian continent and Cape Prince of Wales, Alaska, the westernmost point (168 degrees 05′ W) of the North American continent, with latitude of about 65 degrees 40′ North, slightly south of the polar circle.</p>
<h2 id=is-the-bering-strait-international-waters>Is the Bering Strait international waters?</h2>
<p>The Bering Sea is separated from the Gulf of Alaska by the Alaska Peninsula. The Bering Sea ecosystem includes resources within the jurisdiction of the United States and Russia, as well as international waters in the middle of the sea (known as the “Donut Hole”).</p>
<h2 id=what-are-the-oceans-that-the-bering-strait-connects-to>What are the oceans that the Bering Strait connects to?</h2>
<p>Alaska which is bordered by the Arctic Ocean and the Pacific Ocean as well as the Bering Sea, the Chukchi Sea and the Bering Strait. What actors and actresses appeared in The Ballad of Bering Strait – 2003?</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-climate-of-the-bering-strait>What was the climate of the Bering Strait?</h2>
<p>As a waterway, the Bering Strait connects the Pacific Ocean to the Arctic Ocean over the polar ice cap, and eventually the Atlantic Ocean. The climate of the Bering Land Bridge (BLB) when it was above sea level during the Pleistocene was long thought to have been primarily a herbaceous tundra or steppe-tundra.</p>
<h2 id=can-a-cruise-ship-sail-through-the-bering-strait>Can a cruise ship sail through the Bering Strait?</h2>
<p>As sea ice continues to melt, the passage through the Bering Strait has become easier for vessels, and commercial shipping interest is increasing. Recently, a luxury cruise ship was able to sail from the North Pacific to the Atlantic via the fabled Northwest Passage—a route that once defeated even the most intrepid explorers.</p>
<h2 id=where-does-warm-water-enter-the-bering-sea>Where does warm water enter the Bering Sea?</h2>
<p>Warm oceanic waters from the south enter the Bering Sea through the numerous straits of the Fox Islands, through the Amchitka and Tanaga passes, and to a great extent through the Blizhny Strait between Attu and Medny islands. The Attu, Tanaga, and Transverse currents carry the warm water to the northwest.</p>
