<h2 id=which-famous-leader-of-israel-wrote-many-of-the-psalms>Which famous leader of Israel wrote many of the Psalms?</h2>
<p>David is celebrated as a warrior, prophet, musician and lover; the ultimate Renaissance man if you like. He is credited with writing many of the Old Testament Psalms, composed no doubt on his famous lyre on which he was said to be a virtuoso.</p>
<h2 id=who-wrote-most-of-the-psalms>Who wrote most of the Psalms?</h2>
<p>Many carry the names of individuals, the most common (73 psalms—75 if including the two Psalms attributed by the New Testament to David) being ‘of David’, and thirteen of these relate explicitly to incidents in the king’s life.</p>
<h2 id=how-many-psalms-were-written-by-king-david>How many Psalms were written by King David?</h2>
<p>73<br>
The book of Psalms in the Old Testament is our topic this week. Though there are 150 of them, it is known that David wrote 73, if not more. Although they cover a multitude of topics, they all were written in praise of God. They all center on a cry, a need, or even a joyful song dedicated to God.</p>
<h2 id=who-was-considered-the-greatest-king-of-israel>Who was considered the greatest king of Israel?</h2>
<p>King David (II Samuel 5:3) c. 1004–970 BCE – who made Jerusalem the capital of the United Kingdom of Israel.</p>
<h2 id=who-wrote-psalms-69>Who wrote Psalms 69?</h2>
<p>Angel Bearing a Sponge by Antonio Giorgetti, with the inscription “potaverunt me aceto” (“they gave me vinegar to drink”, Psalms 69:22)….</p>
<table><tr><th>Psalm 69</th></tr><tr><td>A monk engulfed in water clings to the central curve of an initial S of the first verse.</td></tr><tr><td>Other name</td><td>Psalm 68 (Vulgate) “Salvum me fac Deus”</td></tr></table>
<h2 id=who-wrote-psalms-69-1>Who wrote psalms 69?</h2>
<h2 id=did-solomon-write-any-of-the-psalms>Did Solomon write any of the psalms?</h2>
<p>Psalms of Solomon, a pseudepigraphal work (not in any biblical canon) comprising 18 psalms that were originally written in Hebrew, although only Greek and Syriac translations survive.</p>
<h2 id=what-does-psalms-46-5-say>What does psalms 46 5 say?</h2>
<p>Psalm 46:5 “God is within her, she will not fall; God will help her at break of day.”</p>
<h2 id=what-did-king-david-write-in-the-bible>What did King David write in the Bible?</h2>
<p>The Book of Psalms contains psalms written by King David as well as other Biblical figures.</p>
<h2 id=how-many-books-of-psalms-did-king-david-give-israel>How many books of Psalms did King David give Israel?</h2>
<p>The division of five books seems to have been King David’s intention. The Midrash explains that Moses gave Isral five books of the Torah and David gave Israel five books of Psalms. The first four books each end with a similar verse of thanksgiving for having completed that book, while the fifth ends with an entire psalm of gratitude.</p>
<h2 id=who-are-the-authors-of-the-psalms-in-the-bible>Who are the authors of the Psalms in the Bible?</h2>
<p>Although King David did not write all of the Psalms, he is its most prolific author with eighty of them credited to him. Other writers include Moses, Heman the Ezrahite, Ethan the Ezrahite, Solomon, Asaph, and the sons of Korah. Several of them do not come with any credit. Collectively,…</p>
<h2 id=who-are-all-the-authors-of-the-bible>Who are all the authors of the Bible?</h2>
<p>These ones are his, specifically: 1 Psalms 3–9 2 Psalms 11–41 3 Psalms 51–65 4 Psalms 68–70 5 Psalm 86 6 Psalm 101 7 Psalm 103 8 Psalms 108–110 9 Psalm 122 10 Psalm 124 11 Psalm 131 12 Psalm 133 13 Psalms 138–145 More …</p>
<h2 id=is-the-book-of-psalms-compared-to-the-torah>Is the Book of Psalms compared to the Torah?</h2>
<p>Answer: It is the only book in Tanach that is compared to the Torah itself. 7 More than just a collection of beautiful songs composed by various authors, it is considered the “Bible of Prayer.” Just as all of Torah is sourced in the five books of Moses, prayer in Judaism is sourced in the five books of Psalms.</p>
