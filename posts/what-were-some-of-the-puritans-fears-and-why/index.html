</ul>
<h2 id=who-were-the-puritans-fighting-with>Who were the Puritans fighting with?</h2>
<p>The Puritans were English Protestants in the 16th and 17th centuries who sought to purify the Church of England of Roman Catholic practices, maintaining that the Church of England had not been fully reformed and should become more Protestant.</p>

<h2 id=how-did-the-puritans-affect-the-development-of-early-new-england-society>How did the Puritans affect the development of early New England society?</h2>
<p>The morals and ideals held by Puritans between 1630 and 1670 influenced the social development of the colonies by putting into practice a series of rules, which our own founding fathers would use to create the political structure of the New England colonies.</p>
<h2 id=what-started-the-salem-witch-trials>What started the Salem witch trials?</h2>

<p>Puritans facing religious persecution in England set out for the New World, where they established a colony at Plymouth. Puritans were English Protestants who were committed to “purifying” the Church of England by eliminating all aspects of Catholicism from religious practices.</p>
<h2 id=why-did-the-church-of-england-oppose-the-puritans>Why did the Church of England oppose the Puritans?</h2>
