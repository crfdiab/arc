<h2 id=what-episode-do-deeks-and-kensi-get-together>What episode do Deeks and Kensi get together?</h2>
<p>“Humbug” (Season 6, Episode 11) After dancing around each other for about a year following their night together, Kensi finally decides to be “bold” and go “all in” just in time for Christmas.</p>
<h2 id=what-episode-do-deeks-and-kensi-kiss>What episode do Deeks and Kensi kiss?</h2>
<p>(Season 3, Episode 22) First undercover kiss. Saying ‘I Do’ When: Season Ten, Episode 17. Kensi talking about the “cute little twitchy thing” that Deeks does with his nose.</p>
<h2 id=does-deeks-leave-ncis-la-for-good>Does Deeks leave NCIS LA for good?</h2>
<p>But then NCIS: LA revealed that Deeks’s job as a liaison between the NCIS and the LAPD is done—permanently. But before you cut the TV cord, get a load of this good news: Daniela spoke out and all but confirmed that Eric and Deeks aren’t going anywhere.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-wrong-with-kensi-blyes-eye>What is wrong with Kensi Blye’s eye?</h2>
<p>“It’s a birthmark called nevus of Ota. It covers the whole white of my eye and darkens it. The square of the eye, the white part, is completely dark on my right eye, not just the iris,” she said.</p>
<h2 id=what-happens-to-kensi-and-deeks-on-ncis-los-angeles>What happens to Kensi and Deeks on NCIS Los Angeles?</h2>
<p>Whether the two will catch a break remains to be seen–although Ruah does hint at a possible positive resolution down the line. Even so, in the present, Kensi has lost her partner of 11 years and is functioning on her own. It will work out to her advantage in this Sunday night’s “Raising the Dead” episode, when she is recalled to an old case.</p>
<h2 id=how-are-kensi-and-marty-from-ncis-la-related>How are Kensi and Marty from NCIS LA related?</h2>
<p>NCIS: LA’s Kensi and Deeks Are Related in Real Life as She’s Married to His Lookalike Brother. This year, onscreen characters Kensi Blye and Marty Deeks from “NCIS: Los Angeles” got married. However, some fans aren’t aware that the actors who play these characters are actually closer than we think.</p>
<h2 id=what-happens-to-kensi-and-deeks-season-12>What happens to Kensi and Deeks season 12?</h2>
<p>Life started to fall apart for Kensi ( Daniela Ruah) and Deeks ( Eric Christian Olsen) last month on the Season 12 premiere of NCIS: Los Angeles when Deeks was informed that his services as an LAPD liaison to NCIS were no longer needed. And to make matters worse, he can’t return to the LAPD because of cutbacks, his job there was also eliminated.</p>
<h2 id=is-the-actor-who-plays-deeks-on-ncis-married>Is the actor who plays Deeks on NCIS Married?</h2>
<p>Daniela and her co-star, Eric Christian Olsen (he plays Deeks) are related in real life. However, Daniela and Eric are not married. She is married to Eric’s brother, David Paul Olsen.</p>
