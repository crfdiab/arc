<h2 id=who-was-the-leader-of-portugal-in-the-1400s>Who was the leader of Portugal in the 1400s?</h2>
<p>Sebastian of Portugal was the penultimate Portuguese monarch of the House of Aviz. He was the son of John Manuel, Prince of Portugal, and his wife, Joanna of Austria. Sebastian succeeded to the throne at the age of three, on the death of King John III, his paternal grandfather.</p>
<h2 id=who-ruled-portugal-in-1492>Who ruled Portugal in 1492?</h2>
<p>His three queens were Spanish. The first was Isabella, eldest daughter of cosovereigns Ferdinand and Isabella and widow of John II’s heir. As a condition of the marriage, Manuel was to expel the Jews, many thousands of whom had been admitted by John II on their expulsion from Spain in 1492.</p>
<h2 id=who-was-the-leader-of-portugal-in-the-fifteenth-century>Who was the leader of Portugal in the fifteenth century?</h2>
<p>Under the leadership of Prince Henry the Navigator, Portugal took the principal role during most of the fifteenth century in searching for a route to Asia by sailing south around Africa. In the process, the Portuguese accumulated a wealth of knowledge about navigation and the geography of the Atlantic Ocean.</p>
<h2 id=why-did-christopher-columbus-go-to-portugal-in-1476>Why did Christopher Columbus go to Portugal in 1476?</h2>
<p>Although neither Portuguese-born nor sponsored, Columbus was Portuguese trained. He went to Lisbon in 1476 and remained there for several years, seeking the support of the Portuguese king and gathering nautical and geographic intelligence from the returning sailors.</p>
<h2 id=who-was-joao-ii-of-portugal-married-to>Who was Joao II of Portugal married to?</h2>
<p>He married a Portuguese woman; obtained navigation charts and related information from his father-in-law, Bartholomew Perestrelo, who was the governor of the island of Porto Santo in Madeira; and was employed by João II as a navigator.</p>
<h2 id=what-did-prince-henry-the-navigator-do-in-lisbon>What did Prince Henry the navigator do in Lisbon?</h2>
<p>Peter returned with a current world map from Venice. In 1431, Henry donated houses for the Estudo Geral to teach all the sciences—grammar, logic, rhetoric, arithmetic, music, and astronomy—in what would later become the University of Lisbon.</p>
