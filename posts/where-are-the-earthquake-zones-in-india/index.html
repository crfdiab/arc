<h2 id=where-are-the-earthquake-zones-in-india>Where are the earthquake zones in India?</h2>
<p>The regions of Kashmir, the Western and Central Himalayas, North and Middle Bihar, the North-East Indian region, the Rann of Kutch and the Andaman and Nicobar group of islands fall in this zone. Generally, the areas having trap rock or basaltic rock are prone to earthquakes.</p>
<h2 id=how-many-zones-of-earthquake-are-there-in-india>How many zones of earthquake are there in India?</h2>
<p>FOUR SEISMIC ZONES<br>
INDIA’s FOUR SEISMIC ZONES: These are zones II, III, IV and V. Among these, Zone V is the most seismically active region and zone II is the least active.</p>
<h2 id=what-type-of-plate-boundary-is-between-india-and-asia>What type of plate boundary is between India and Asia?</h2>
<p>As the Indian plate is moving northward relative to the Eurasian plate and collides with it, a convergent boundary is created.</p>
<h2 id=is-delhi-safe-for-earthquake>Is Delhi safe for earthquake?</h2>
<p>Professor Chandan Ghosh of the civil engineering department of IIT Jammu said that Delhi falls in the northern region. It is in Zone-4 in terms of earthquake, so it is sensitive.</p>
<h2 id=where-are-earthquakes-most-likely-to-occur-in-india>Where are earthquakes most likely to occur in India?</h2>
<p>Apart from these regions, the central-western parts of India, particularly Gujarat and Maharashtra have also experienced some severe earthquakes. Bureau of Indian Standards, based on the past seismic history, grouped the country into four seismic zones, viz. Zone II, III, IV and V.</p>
<h2 id=where-are-earthquake-zones-located-in-the-world>Where are earthquake zones located in the world?</h2>
<p>Another zone of high seismic activity is at the meeting point the Eurasian plate with a number of smaller plates from the south, including the Indian. This Eurasian zone begins from under the Mediterranean Sea and travels through western Asia, the Himalayas, the Arakans, Sumatra and Java, meeting the circum Pacific belt.</p>

<h2 id=how-big-was-the-fault-in-the-indian-ocean-earthquake>How big was the fault in the Indian Ocean earthquake?</h2>
<p>An estimated 1,600 km (1,000 mi) of fault surface slipped (or ruptured) about 15 m (50 ft) along the subduction zone where the Indian Plate slides (or subducts) under the overriding Burma Plate.</p>
