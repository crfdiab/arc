<h2 id=how-have-people-in-france-modified-their-environment>How have people in France modified their environment?</h2>
<p>Humans adapt to the environment- France experiences heavy snowfall in the alpine areas. The French adjust to this by wearing warmer clothes, and heating their home. In addition, France takes the opportunity to build ski resorts, which attracts several tourists.</p>
<h2 id=how-have-people-changed-the-environment-of-paris-france>How have people changed the environment of Paris France?</h2>
<p>Water pollution is a big problem in France at the moment because Paris is becoming more of an industrial city, and is acquiring industrial contaminants. The farming has caused agricultural nitrates, and from a big city like Paris, there is a lot of waste. All of these pollutions are polluting the water.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-the-french-revolution-change-land-ownership>How did the French Revolution change land ownership?</h2>
<p>In 1789, the revolutionary government seized French lands owned by the church, about 6.5% of the country, and redistributed them through auction. They also found more inequality in the size of farms, thanks to consolidation of previously fragmented land, than in areas with less redistribution.</p>
<h2 id=what-were-the-changes-in-france>What were the changes in France?</h2>
<p>The French Revolution completely changed the social and political structure of France. It put an end to the French monarchy, feudalism, and took political power from the Catholic church. Although the revolution ended with the rise of Napoleon, the ideas and reforms did not die.</p>
<h2 id=what-does-france-do-for-the-environment>What does France do for the environment?</h2>
<p>France has a very ambitious environmental-policy agenda, aimed chiefly at cutting greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions but also at dealing with local air and water pollution, waste management and the conservation of biodiversity.</p>
<h2 id=how-have-the-people-modified-their-environment-in-france>How have the people modified their environment in France?</h2>
<p>France’s environment has been changed in several ways by the people that live there. There has been lots of pollution lately due to cars and other industrial plant. There is also water pollution from urban waste and other trash in cities. There has also been some forest damage. In the country, farms were modernized and were cleaned up.</p>
<h2 id=what-has-changed-over-the-years-in-france>What has changed over the years in France?</h2>
<p>One thing is certain today’s France is no longer the same as it was twenty or fifteen years ago. And it does not seem that it has changed for the better, quite the opposite… And the proof of this is already clearly visible on the streets.</p>
<h2 id=what-do-you-know-about-the-geography-of-france>What do you know about the geography of France?</h2>
<p>Geography of France 1 History of France. France has a long history and, according to the U.S. 2 Government of France. Today, France is considered a republic with executive, legislative, and judicial branches of government. 3 Economics and Land Use in France. 4 Geography and Climate of France. 5 Sources. …</p>
<h2 id=why-are-there-so-many-immigrants-in-france>Why are there so many immigrants in France?</h2>
<p>The problem is, therefore, in the French people, who, despite not being prepared to welcome this migratory mass that has reached the Gauls, continue to vote and elect those who want a multicultural France and Europe for their own interest. Thus the differences lie in the profile of the current and former immigrants.</p>
