<h2 id=how-does-climate-change-affect-trade>How does climate change affect trade?</h2>
<p>Consequences from climate change can disrupt trade Direct consequences of climate change on trade could come from more frequent extreme weather events and rising sea levels. Supply, transport and distribution chains infrastructure are likely to become more vulnerable to disruptions due to climate change.</p>
<h2 id=how-does-climate-change-affect-the-economy-in-canada>How does climate change affect the economy in Canada?</h2>
<p>A recent study on the global economic impacts of climate change by Moody’s concluded that Canada could be a “climate winner”: one of few countries that might benefit from a warming world. According to Moody’s, Canada’s GDP could increase by up to 0.3 per cent—about $9 billion per year—by the middle of this century.</p>
<h2 id=how-does-climate-affect-canada>How does climate affect Canada?</h2>
<p>The effects of global warming on Canada’s environment include more extreme weather. Hotter temperatures could mean more heat waves and a higher risk of wildfires and droughts in some parts of the country. Oceans are expected to become more acidic and less oxygenated, which could harm marine life.</p>
<h2 id=how-does-climate-change-affect-goods-and-services>How does climate change affect goods and services?</h2>
<p>As the climate changes, demand will shift. As global temperatures rise, for instance, demand for heating oil will decline — as will demand for other winter goods. More consumers are also prioritizing sustainability in the products they buy, shifting demand toward more environmentally friendly goods.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-the-effects-of-change-in-trade>What are the effects of change in trade?</h2>
<p>The increase in imports from tariff reduction beneficiaries is balanced by a decrease in imports from all others. For the market, the trade effect is only trade creation. For exporting countries, total trade effect is made of trade diversion and trade creation.</p>
<h2 id=what-part-of-canada-is-most-affected-by-climate-change>What part of Canada is most affected by climate change?</h2>
<p>Atlantic Canada<br>
Atlantic Canada is one regions in Canada most threatened by global climate change. The region will experience more storm events, increasing storm intensity, rising sea levels, storm surges, coastal erosion and flooding from a warming in global temperatures.</p>
<h2 id=where-in-canada-is-most-affected-by-climate-change>Where in Canada is most affected by climate change?</h2>
<p>Atlantic Canada is one regions in Canada most threatened by global climate change. The region will experience more storm events, increasing storm intensity, rising sea levels, storm surges, coastal erosion and flooding from a warming in global temperatures.</p>
<h2 id=how-will-climate-change-affect-us>How will climate change affect us?</h2>
<p>Increased heat, drought and insect outbreaks, all linked to climate change, have increased wildfires. Declining water supplies, reduced agricultural yields, health impacts in cities due to heat, and flooding and erosion in coastal areas are additional concerns.</p>
<h2 id=how-does-international-trade-affect-the-canadian-economy>How does international trade affect the Canadian economy?</h2>
<p>The effects of international trade are both micro and macro. Companies benefit from it, and the effect ladders up to the economy at scale. Maximizing use of raw materials. From lumber, oil, gas and more, Canada has an abundance of raw materials for which there is international demand.</p>
<h2 id=how-is-canadas-agriculture-industry-adapting-to-climate-change>How is Canada’s agriculture industry adapting to climate change?</h2>
<p>While there’s a lot of uncertainty surrounding the future of Canada’s agriculture industry, one thing is clear: we are likely to see more extreme weather events, soil erosion and higher average temperatures. Farmers must look at environmentally-friendly farming practices to adapt to the effects of climate change and stay in business.</p>
<h2 id=how-does-weather-affect-the-economy-in-canada>How does weather affect the economy in Canada?</h2>
<p>Using weather data, we plan to examine the effect of weather events on key Canadian macroeconomic variables such as growth and inflation. Some of the effects might be predictable and could be incorporated in the Bank’s forecasting models, while others might be less predictable, giving rise to economic shocks.</p>
<h2 id=how-does-climate-location-and-natural-resources-affect-where-canadians-live>How does climate, location and natural resources affect where Canadians live?</h2>
<p>How climate, location, and natural resources affect where Canadians live and how they trade. Like this presentation? Why not share! How climate, location, and natural resources affect where Canadians live and how they trade.</p>
