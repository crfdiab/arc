<h2 id=does-the-president-elect-have-to-take-the-oath-of-office>Does the President elect have to take the oath of office?</h2>
<p>The 20th amendment to the Constitution specifies that the term of each elected President of the United States begins at noon on January 20 of the year following the election. Each president must take the oath of office before assuming the duties of the position.</p>
<h2 id=what-oath-must-the-president-take>What oath must the president take?</h2>
<p>“I do solemnly swear (or affirm) that I will faithfully execute the Office of President of the United States, and will to the best of my ability, preserve, protect and defend the Constitution of the United States.”</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-oath-of-office-for-president-of-the-united-states>What is the oath of office for President of the United States?</h2>
<p>“I do solemnly swear (or affirm) that I will faithfully execute the office of President of the United States, and will to the best of my ability, preserve, protect, and defend the Constitution of the United States.”.</p>
<h2 id=what-kind-of-oath-does-a-vice-president-take>What kind of oath does a vice president take?</h2>
<p>The oath of office of the vice president of the United States is the oath or affirmation that the vice president of the United States takes upon assuming the vice-presidency but before he or she begins the execution of the office. It is the same oath that members of the United States Congress take upon entering office.</p>
<h2 id=do-you-need-a-bible-to-take-an-oath-of-office>Do you need a Bible to take an oath of office?</h2>
<p>For example, the story claims that the U.S. Constitution requires elected officials to be sworn in using the Bible. The Constitution says no such thing. Article VI requires that senators and representatives take an “oath or affirmation, to support this Constitution,” but it says nothing about using the Bible.</p>
<h2 id=what-does-a-president-have-to-do-before-taking-office>What does a president have to do before taking office?</h2>
<p>Before he enter on the Execution of his Office, he shall take the following Oath or Affirmation:– I do solemnly swear (or affirm) that I will faithfully execute the Office of President of the United States, and will to the best of my Ability, preserve, protect and defend the Constitution of the United States.</p>
