<p>SOLUTION: You can use a pencil eraser to tuck the hook towards the gums. If it is a molar hook place wax over it until it stops poking. Warm saltwater rinses two to three times per day.</p>
<h2 id=can-braces-dig-into-your-gums>Can braces dig into your gums?</h2>
<p>Even though you can’t see your teeth moving, the constant, steady pressure that braces apply causes changes to occur in your gums and jaw bone. Gum swelling and pain are a common reaction to getting braces for the first time. Braces also need to be adjusted frequently, around once a month, causing gum discomfort.</p>
<h2 id=what-happens-if-your-gums-touch-your-braces>What happens if your gums touch your braces?</h2>
<p>In addition to gingivitis, the gum tissues can react to the braces by causing hypertrophy (“hyper” – over; “trophy” – growth of individual cells) or hyperplasia (“plasia” – increase in the number of cells). Either way, what you notice as swelling of the gum tissues gives the smile an unusual appearance.</p>
<h2 id=is-it-normal-for-braces-to-cut-your-mouth>Is it normal for braces to cut your mouth?</h2>
<p>Unfortunately, many patients experience braces cutting lips and cheeks.</p>
<h2 id=can-you-eat-with-wax-on-your-braces>Can you eat with wax on your braces?</h2>
<p>Dental wax is perfectly safe and it’s ok to accidentally swallow some as it wears away. Some waxes may even be flavored with mint or other natural and safe ingredients. Over time, dental wax will wear away and rub or flake off your braces. That is totally normal, and again, it’s safe to digest.</p>
<h2 id=how-can-i-get-my-gums-healthy-again>How can I get my gums healthy again?</h2>
<p>Here are a few ways you can help keep your gums healthy.</p>
<ol>
<li>Floss. Floss at least once a day.</li>
<li>Get regular dental cleanings. Your dentist can detect early gum disease symptoms if you see them on a regular basis.</li>
<li>Quit smoking.</li>
<li>Brush twice a day.</li>
<li>Use fluoride toothpaste.</li>
<li>Use a therapeutic mouthwash.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id=how-do-you-fix-gum-overgrowth>How do you fix gum overgrowth?</h2>
<p>Gingival hyperplasia can be resolved by improving oral hygiene habits. In more severe cases, surgical treatment is necessary….Some procedures used to remove overgrown gums include:</p>
<ol>
<li>Laser excision. A periodontist will use lasers to remove inflamed gum tissue.</li>
<li>Electrosurgery.</li>
<li>Periodontal flap surgery.</li>
<li>Gingivectomy.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id=which-gum-is-good-for-braces>Which gum is good for braces?</h2>
<p>Dentists often recommend chewing sugarless gum that has received the ADA Seal of Acceptance. Newer material used in braces also differ significantly from those used in previous braces. Wires may be more flexible than they used to be and less likely to bend from chewing gum.</p>
<h2 id=can-i-remove-braces-myself>Can I remove braces myself?</h2>
<p>Removing braces yourself could be a way to self-inflict real pain. During the self-removal process, the gums may even start to bleed, and you will be at the risk of dental infections. You just cannot use any tools to remove braces at home.</p>
<h2 id=can-i-sleep-with-dental-wax>Can I sleep with dental wax?</h2>
<p>Do: Keep the wax in place overnight. Don’t: Worry if you swallow it while sleeping or eating. Do: Contact your orthodontist if the pain persists or comes on suddenly. Don’t: Try to fix, bend, or repair wires or brackets by yourself.</p>
<h2 id=how-long-do-braces-hurt-for>How long do braces hurt for?</h2>
<p>Mild pain or discomfort is a normal side effect of wearing braces. But you should only feel the discomfort immediately after your orthodontist places or adjusts your braces or wires. The discomfort typically disappears within four days, and braces pain rarely lasts longer than a week.</p>
<h2 id=why-does-the-wire-come-out-of-my-braces>Why does the wire come out of my braces?</h2>
<p>The orthodontist bends them to put a force on your teeth through brackets. Because of certain causes, sometimes one end of the braces wire can poke out from the back bracket. This sharp end of metallic wire pokes your cheek.</p>
<h2 id=what-happens-to-the-gums-when-you-have-braces>What happens to the gums when you have braces?</h2>
<p>Gingival hyperplasia is also referred to as gingival enlargement, or hypertrophy. It results from an overgrowth of gum tissue around the teeth. Gingival hyperplasia from braces typically reduces by increased or more effective oral hygiene habits.</p>
<h2 id=whats-the-best-way-to-poke-wire-on-braces>What’s the best way to poke wire on braces?</h2>
<p>Put the ball of wax on your fingertip. Touch the wax to the poking wire or bracket. Press down gently to cover the wire. Pressure on your teeth or braces while receiving orthodontic treatment can cause some discomfort. If you feel soreness while pressing on the wire this is completely normal.</p>
