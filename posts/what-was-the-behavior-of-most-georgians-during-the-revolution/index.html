<p>You would need to create a new account….Revolution.</p>
<table><tr><th>Question</th><th>Answer</th></tr><tr><td>What was the behavior for most Georgians during the revolution</td><td>They were loyal to the king (George the 3)</td></tr></table>
<h2 id=how-was-georgias-role-in-the-revolutionary-war-affected-by-attitudes-of-the-colonists>How was Georgia’s role in the Revolutionary War affected by attitudes of the colonists?</h2>
<p>As a colony, Georgia contained strong Loyalist sentiment. Loyalists were those American colonists who did not want independence from Great Britain but instead remained ‘loyal’ to the Crown.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-the-colonists-feel-during-the-revolutionary-war>How did the colonists feel during the Revolutionary War?</h2>
<p>The colonists felt that since they did not take part in voting for members of Parliament in England they were not represented in Parliament. So Parliament did not have the right to take their money by imposing taxes. “No taxation without representation” became the American rallying cry.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-role-of-georgia-during-the-american-revolution>What was the role of Georgia during the American Revolution?</h2>
<p>When violence broke out in 1775, radical Patriots (also known as Whigs) took control of the provincial government, and drove many Loyalists out of the province. Georgia also served as the staging ground for several important raids into British-controlled Florida.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-the-stamp-act-impact-georgia-colonists>How did the Stamp Act impact Georgia colonists?</h2>
<p>What did the Stamp Act Tax? Common everyday items like newspapers, licenses, and legal documents. Most colonists reacted violently by, hanging effigies from parliamentary leaders and royal goveners, attacking the homes of Brittish officials, and taring and feathering tax colectors.</p>
<h2 id=what-did-colonists-in-georgia-do-for-fun>What did colonists in Georgia do for fun?</h2>
<p>Boys would get sticks and pretend they were horses that they could ride on. Both boys and girls would play with spinning tops or do jump rope, scotch hopper (hop-scotch) or pins, which was similar to bowling. They also had board games and battledore, which is similar to badminton.</p>
<h2 id=what-started-revolutionary-war>What started Revolutionary War?</h2>
<p>On April 19, local militiamen clashed with British soldiers in the Battles of Lexington and Concord in Massachusetts, marking the “shot heard round the world” that signified the start of the Revolutionary War.</p>
<h2 id=why-was-georgia-slow-in-joining-the-revolution>Why was Georgia slow in joining the revolution?</h2>
<p>Revolutionary fervor was slow to take hold in colonial Georgia, largely due to the effective leadership of Royal Governor Sir James Wright. However, in July 1775, a Provincial Congress was established to govern in opposition to Royal Authority.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-role-of-georgia-in-the-american-revolution>What was the role of Georgia in the American Revolution?</h2>
<p>Georgia did not play as great a role in the American Revolution as other colonies. Let’s find out why. Bearing reference to King George II, the colony of Georgia was strongly Loyalist. Loyalists were American colonists who remained ‘loyal’ to the king, and did not want independence from Great Britain. Basically they were the opposite of ‘Patriots.’</p>
<h2 id=what-did-the-colony-of-georgia-do-for-a-living>What did the colony of Georgia do for a living?</h2>
<p>◆ Georgia was a proprietary colony from 1732 till 1752, which meant that it was managed by a board of trustees in Britain. In 1752, citing failure of the trustees in managing it, the king declared it as a royal colony. ◆ Georgia, as a royal colony, provided Britain with deerskin, leather, naval stores, indigo, pork, beef, lumber, and rice.</p>
<h2 id=where-was-anti-british-sentiment-not-as-strong-in-georgia>Where was anti-British sentiment not as strong in Georgia?</h2>
<p>So on the eve of the American Revolution, anti-British sentiment was not nearly as strong in Georgia as it was in other colonies like Boston, New York, or even Virginia.</p>
