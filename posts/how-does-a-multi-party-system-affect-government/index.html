<h2 id=how-does-a-multi-party-system-affect-government>How does a multi-party system affect government?</h2>
<p>A multi-party system prevents the leadership of a single party from controlling a single legislative chamber without challenge. If the government includes an elected Congress or Parliament, the parties may share power according to proportional representation or the first-past-the-post system.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-a-multi-party-system-explain-its-merits-and-demerits>What is a multi-party system explain its merits and demerits?</h2>
<p>(i) This system allows a variety of interests and opinions to enjoy political representation. (ii) People can make a choice between several candidates. Demerits: (i) No one party is likely to gain power alone. (ii) Leads to political instability and often appears to be very messy.</p>

<h2 id=how-did-multi-party-system-work-in-nigeria>How did multi party system work in Nigeria?</h2>
<p>The late Oba of Lagos, Adele was a strong supporter of the Action Group (through the Area Council Party) while his successor, Oba Oyekan was a supporter of the NCNC and a personal friend of its leader, Dr. Azikiwe.

<h2 id=what-do-you-mean-by-multi-party-system>What do you mean by multi party system?</h2>
<p>Recall that a multi-party system is a system in which multiple political parties have the capacity to gain control of government offices, separately or in coalition. In other words, multi-party systems are systems in which more than two parties are represented and elected to public office.</p>
<h2 id=how-many-political-parties-are-there-in-nigeria>How many political parties are there in Nigeria?</h2>
<p>For the purpose of this article, it is assumed that Nigeria is a democracy and currently practising one of its cardinal principles – leaving the choice of governance to more than one political association or political party.
