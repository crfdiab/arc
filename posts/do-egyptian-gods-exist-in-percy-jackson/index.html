<h2 id=do-egyptian-gods-exist-in-percy-jackson>Do Egyptian gods exist in Percy Jackson?</h2>
<p>Interestingly, in Percy Jackson’s Greek Gods, Percy mentions that since most of the Olympian gods fled from Typhon all the way to Egypt in the form of animals, they might have induced Egyptian myths about “gods with animal heads.” However, Percy admits that this is unlikely since Egyptian myths are much older than …</p>
<h2 id=what-is-carter-kanes-secret-name>What is Carter Kane’s secret name?</h2>
<p>Set’s secret name, as told by Zia, is Evil Day.</p>
<h2 id=does-sadie-kane-end-up-with-anubis>Does Sadie Kane end up with Anubis?</h2>
<p>In fact, in The Throne of Fire, Anubis goes as far as to wish her a happy birthday, then kisses her.

<h2 id=which-god-does-not-have-a-cabin-at-camp-half-blood>Which God does not have a cabin at Camp Half Blood?</h2>
<p>He snapped her spear by accident, eventually they became friends. Percy Jackson also has another friend, Nico D’Angelo, who is the son of Hades. Hades does not have a cabin in the camp because he was kicked off of Olympus. So Nico doesn’t have a place to stay so he lives with his father Hades.</p>

<h2 id=why-does-anubis-kiss-sadie>Why does Anubis kiss Sadie?</h2>
<p>The Throne of Fire Anubis gives Sadie a knife for the opening of the mouth ceremony for her birthday in London and kisses her. Sadie is in a bit of a romantic dilemma here because she has strong feelings about Anubis who has even kissed her, but also is attracted to Walt.</p>
<h2 id=does-anubis-love-sadie>Does Anubis love Sadie?</h2>
<p>Anubis is the God of Death and Funerals in Egyptian mythology and a love interest of Sadie Kane in The Kane Chronicles book series. Sadie first met Anubis in her ba travels and fell in love with him at once and Anubis eventually returned the feelings.</p>
<h2 id=is-hades-evil-in-percy-jackson>Is Hades evil in Percy Jackson?</h2>
<p>From trying to kill newborn Hercules, and unleashing the Titans on Zeus in Disney’s Hercules, to betraying the god in order to overthrow him in both the Clash of the Titans movies and Percy Jackson and the Lightning Thief, Hades is usually portrayed as an evil and jealous god who wants to take his brother’s throne.</p>
<h2 id=is-camp-half-blood-real>Is Camp Half-Blood real?</h2>
<p>But Camp Half-Blood is no longer just a fictional training ground. At Brownstone Books’ Camp Half-Blood in Brooklyn, the campers’ adventures come right out of Greek mythology. Campers give offerings to the gods before they eat. There are daily quests and even prophesies that sometimes pop up on counselors’ cell phones.</p>
<h2 id=who-are-the-gods-and-goddesses-at-camp-half-blood>Who are the gods and goddesses at Camp Half Blood?</h2>

<h2 id=how-many-cabins-are-there-in-camp-half-blood>How many cabins are there in Camp Half Blood?</h2>
<p>Now there are twenty cabins at Camp Half-Blood as of The Hidden Oracle, but Jason Grace was planning to get cabins for all minor gods and goddesses. It is unknown if the plans for these cabins even survived after his death, as Apollo only managed to salvage his blueprints of Camp Jupiter.</p>
<h2 id=where-is-camp-half-blood-in-heroes-of-olympus>Where is Camp Half Blood in Heroes of Olympus?</h2>
<p>The Fleece stays on the tree, guarded by the dragon Peleus, its magical powers protecting the camp from monsters and invaders.
