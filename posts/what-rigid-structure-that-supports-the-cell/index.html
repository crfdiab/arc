<h2 id=what-rigid-structure-that-supports-the-cell>What rigid structure that supports the cell?</h2>
<p>Cell Wall<br>
Cell Wall: This is the rigid outermost layer of a plant cell. It makes the cell stiff -providing the cell with mechanical support – and giving it protection. Animal cells do not have cell walls. Cell Membrane: This is a protective layer that surrounds every cell and separates it from its external environment.</p>
<h2 id=what-provides-a-rigid-structure-for-plant-cells>What provides a rigid structure for plant cells?</h2>
<p>In particular, organelles called chloroplasts allow plants to capture the energy of the Sun in energy-rich molecules; cell walls allow plants to have rigid structures as varied as wood trunks and supple leaves; and vacuoles allow plant cells to change size.</p>
<h2 id=what-gives-rigidity-to-cell>What gives rigidity to cell?</h2>
<p>In mature cells, the secondary wall forms out of Cellulose and lignin and gives the mature cells its necessary rigidity and waterproofing. It is also the thickest layer of all of them. Therefore, the correct answer is lignin. -Giving the cell its definite shape, strength, and rigidity.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-most-rigid-part-of-a-cell>What is the most rigid part of a cell?</h2>
<p>The cell wall is a rigid covering that protects the cell, provides structural support, and gives shape to the cell. Fungal and protistan cells also have cell walls.</p>
<h2 id=what-store-food-or-pigments>What store food or pigments?</h2>
<p>Cells: Structure and Function</p>
<table><tr><th>A</th><th>B</th></tr><tr><td>plastid</td><td>a plant cell structure that stores food of contains pigment</td></tr><tr><td>ribosome</td><td>the “construction site” for proteins</td></tr><tr><td>rough endoplasmic reticulum</td><td>ribosomes can be found in the surface of this organelle.</td></tr><tr><td>flagella</td><td>long, hairlike projection that aids in movement</td></tr></table>
<h2 id=what-controls-what-enters-and-leaves-a-cell>What controls what enters and leaves a cell?</h2>
<p>The cell membrane<br>
The cell membrane is just like the other organelles of cells in that it serves the cell by having its own specialized jobs. One of its jobs is to control what enters and exits the cell and thereby to protect the cell.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-inside-of-a-cell>What is inside of a cell?</h2>
<p>Inside a Cell A cell consists of a nucleus and cytoplasm and is contained within the cell membrane, which regulates what passes in and out. The nucleus contains chromosomes, which are the cell’s genetic material, and a nucleolus, which produces ribosomes. Mitochondria generate energy for the cell’s activities.</p>
<h2 id=what-does-a-nucleus-cell-look-like>What does a nucleus cell look like?</h2>
<p>Shape and appearance Mostly the shape of the nucleus is spherical or oblong. Usually cells have one nucleus but many at times there are multinucleated cells. Multinucleation in cells may be due to karyokinesis (when cell undergoes nuclear division) or when cells fuse to form syncytium, like in mature muscle cells.</p>
<h2 id=what-gives-support-and-structure-to-the-plant-cell>What gives support and structure to the plant cell?</h2>
<p>Support and structure of plant cells is primarily derived from the cell wall. This is a semi-permeable rigid structure surrounds each cell (on the outside of the cell membrane). Secondary support comes from the (fluid filled) vacuoles within each cell, which provide “turgor pressure”. Explanation…</p>
<h2 id=which-is-the-best-definition-of-structural-rigidity>Which is the best definition of structural rigidity?</h2>
<p>A structure is rigid if it cannot flex; that is, if there is no continuous motion of the structure that preserves the shape of its rigid components and the pattern of their connections at the hinges. There are two essentially different kinds of rigidity.</p>
<h2 id=when-do-you-call-a-graph-a-rigid-structure>When do you call a graph a rigid structure?</h2>
<p>That is, a graph is rigid if the structure formed by replacing the edges by rigid rods and the vertices by flexible hinges is rigid. A graph that is not rigid is called flexible.</p>
<h2 id=which-is-the-rigid-structure-of-a-convex-polyhedron>Which is the rigid structure of a convex polyhedron?</h2>
<p>Cauchy’s theorem states that a three-dimensional convex polyhedron constructed with rigid plates for its faces, connected by hinges along its edges, forms a rigid structure. Flexible polyhedra, non-convex polyhedra that are not rigid, were constructed by Raoul Bricard, Robert Connelly, and others.</p>
