<h2 id=how-do-birthdays-work-in-vietnam>How do birthdays work in Vietnam?</h2>
<p>Everyone celebrates their birthday on New Year’s Day in Vietnam, also known as “tet.” Vietnamese tradition is that an individual’s actual day of birth is not to be celebrated. Rather, people become a year older every year at tet, regardless of when they were actually born.</p>

<h2 id=do-they-celebrate-birthdays-in-vietnam>Do they celebrate birthdays in Vietnam?</h2>
<p>Celebrating individual birthdays is rare in Vietnam, where they are instead celebrated on the Vietnamese holiday of Tet, a New Year’s celebration. A similar tradition happens in Korea. In parts of Asia, children are given red envelopes with money inside for their birthdays and New Year’s celebrations.</p>
<h2 id=what-do-vietnamese-eat-for-birthday>What do Vietnamese eat for birthday?</h2>
<p>Hotpot is an indispensable dish in almost every party in Vietnam, including the birthday celebration. Hotpot comes in various kinds, including many different ingredients which can be fish, meat, shrimp, crab, squid, beef, mutton, chicken, duck, etc. Often, the seafood hotpot with sour and sweet tastes is most popular.</p>
<h2 id=does-everyone-in-vietnam-have-the-same-birthday>Does everyone in Vietnam have the same birthday?</h2>
<p>Every person in Vietnam shares the same birthday and it’s celebrated after midnight on New Year’s Eve. So for the Vietnamese community, your age technically doesn’t change on the day you were born, it changes during the Tet holiday.</p>
<h2 id=what-cultures-do-not-celebrate-birthdays>What cultures do not celebrate birthdays?</h2>
<p>Jehovah’s Witnesses do not celebrate birthdays. Orthodox Jews do not celebrate birthdays. Jesus didn’t celebrate birthdays and would be offended that people celebrate Christmas. Islamic cultures don’t celebrate birthdays from what Muslims have shared with me.</p>
<h2 id=how-to-work-out-your-age-in-vietnam>How to work out your age in Vietnam?</h2>
<p>A quick way to work out your age If you’ve already had your birthday this year, Vietnamese age = Western age + 1 If you haven’t had your birthday yet, Vietnamese age = Western age + 2 Birthdays Birthdays are not usually celebrated in Vietnam.</p>
<h2 id=what-do-vietnamese-people-do-for-their-birthday>What do Vietnamese people do for their birthday?</h2>
<p>Vietnamese Birthday Celebrations: Birthday Celebrations from Around the World. BirthdayCelebrations.Net. Songs, recipes, traditions, toys, games, movies, bookmarks, facts, myths, legends. Everyones birthday is celebrated on new years day. Not only is Tet the beginning of a New Year, it is also everyone’s birthday.</p>
<h2 id=how-old-do-you-have-to-be-in-vietnamese-years>How old do you have to be in Vietnamese years?</h2>
<p>However since Vietnamese count you as 1 when you’re born and you get older at Tết, you’d have been 33 years old since the last Tết anyway. And next Tết you’ll be 34 in Vietnamese years. Sorry about that! 3. A quick way to work out your age If you’ve already had your birthday this year, Vietnamese age = Western age + 1</p>
<h2 id=how-is-one-month-old-celebrated-in-vietnam>How is one month old celebrated in Vietnam?</h2>
<p>Celebrating a one-month-old baby is like commemorating a president’s first 100 days in office. Additionally, many Vietnamese mothers are expected to rest indoors (and even take no shower) for a month after giving birth. At the celebration, friends and family present mother and child with luck money.</p>
