<h2 id=what-caused-france-to-industrialize>What caused France to industrialize?</h2>
<p>Industrialization in France France experienced a slow change to commercialized agriculture, power driven machinery and mass production. Even by the end of the nineteenth century, the majority of workers were employed outside of industry. Factories were located mainly in a few cities in the northern part of France.</p>
<h2 id=when-did-the-industrial-revolution-began-in-france>When did the Industrial Revolution began in France?</h2>
<p>1830<br>
The pattern of French Industrialisation Historians like Claude Fohlen believe that the real genesis of modern industry in France took place after 1830. After almost two decades and a half of revolution and revolutionary warfare, French industry had quite some difficulty competing with British industry.</p>
<h2 id=why-did-france-industrialize-later-than-britain>Why did France industrialize later than Britain?</h2>
<p>France lacked natural resources necessary for industrialization. There was no “enclosure movement” in france because of this, and few peasants were forced off their lands.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-french-revolution-lead-to-industrial-revolution>How did French Revolution lead to Industrial Revolution?</h2>
<p>Did the French Revolutionary and Napoleonic wars contribute to the Industrial Revolution? War likely created a demand for superior military technologies, while increased wartime production led to demands for more valuable technologies, which both stimulated the Industrial Revolution.</p>
<h2 id=why-was-the-french-system-of-taxation-unfair>Why was the French system of taxation unfair?</h2>
<p>Excessive, inefficient, unfair According to conventional wisdom, the Ancien Régime’s taxation regime was excessive, inefficient and unfair. It was excessive because France had become one of the highest taxing states in Europe, chiefly because of its warmongering, growing bureaucracy and high spending.</p>
<h2 id=why-was-the-industrial-revolution-delayed-in-france-two-reasons->Why was the Industrial Revolution delayed in France two reasons )?</h2>
<p>Why was the industrial revolution delayed in France? The French Revolution and subsequent wars involving France and its neighbors consumed both the attention and the capital of France’s cities.</p>
<h2 id=what-were-the-main-features-of-the-industrial-revolution-in-england>What were the main features of the Industrial Revolution in England?</h2>
<p>The main features of the Industrial Revolution in England were:</p>
<ul>
<li>Goods were produced in big factories instead of the cottage industries.</li>
<li>Machines took the place of mankind in industrial production.</li>
<li>Due to Industrial Revolution, more employment opportunities were created.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id=which-countries-did-the-industrial-revolution-affect>Which countries did the Industrial Revolution affect?</h2>
<p>The Industrial Revolution occurred only in Britain for about 50 years, but it eventually spread to other countries in Europe , the United States , Russia , and Japan .</p>
<h2 id=what-were-the-effects-of-the-french-revolution>What were the effects of the French Revolution?</h2>
<p>The French Revolution had a great and far-reaching impact that probably transformed the world more than any other revolution. Its repercussions include lessening the importance of religion; rise of Modern Nationalism; spread of Liberalism and igniting the Age of Revolutions.</p>
<h2 id=did-the-industrial-revolution-affect-the-french-revolution>Did the Industrial Revolution affect the French Revolution?</h2>
<p>The industrial change, however, had a longer impact that extended beyond the French Revolution itself. The ramification the industrial revolution had on the French Revolution was minuscule, to the point it was not really noticeable.</p>
<h2 id=why-did-the-french-have-an-industrial-history>Why did the French have an industrial history?</h2>
<p>INDUSTRIAL HISTORY OF FRANCE. One of the main reasons for this was that the “Grande Nation” did not possess as large and accessible natural supplies of coal and iron ore as countries like Great Britain or Belgium. Coal, in particular, was always a scarce commodity; the result was that the French relied on timber for an astonishingly long time.</p>
<h2 id=why-was-france-laggard-in-the-industrial-revolution>Why was France laggard in the Industrial Revolution?</h2>
<p>Some of the reasons for the later French laggardness in industrialisation include the small, family-oriented nature of French firms, which weren’t able to expand rapidly or make the best use of economies of scale, and the relative productivity of French agriculture.</p>
<h2 id=why-did-great-britain-start-the-industrial-revolution>Why did Great Britain start the Industrial Revolution?</h2>
<p>Why did Britain start the industrial revolution? Natural Resources. Another major reason why the Industrial Revolution began in Great Britain was that it had an abundant supply of what economists call the three factors of production. These factors of production are land, labor, and capital.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-result-of-the-french-revolution>What was the result of the French Revolution?</h2>
<p>In addition, French agriculture functioned extraordinarily well. The 1789 revolution freed farmers and peasants from debts and taxes, thereby guaranteeing them a comparatively secure existence. The result was a lack of superfluous workers, a fact which gave a particular boost to the Industrial Revolution in Great Britain.</p>
