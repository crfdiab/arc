<h2 id=why-does-the-saguaro-cactus-live-in-the-desert>Why does the saguaro cactus live in the desert?</h2>
<p>The saguaro cactus is a master of desert survival. Every aspect of this plant is specifically designed to thrive in the sometimes harsh Sonoran Desert. The skin of the saguaro cactus covered with a thick waxy coating that waterproofs the plant, and reduces water lost to the air through transpiration.</p>
<h2 id=what-characteristics-help-a-saguaro-cactus>What characteristics help a saguaro cactus?</h2>
<p>Saguaros are covered with rows of spines that serve to help protect the cactus from predation by food- or moisture-seeking animals, as well as to protect its sensitive growing tip from extreme heat or cold. Saguaros have shallow, extensive roots that absorb rainfall near the surface of the ground.</p>
<h2 id=how-does-the-saguaro-cactus-grow-in-the-desert>How does the saguaro cactus grow in the desert?</h2>
<p>The saguaro cactus (Carnegiea gigantea) is one of the defining plants of the Sonoran Desert. These plants are large, tree-like columnar cacti that develop branches (or arms) as they age, although some never grow arms. These arms generally bend upward and can number over 25.</p>
<h2 id=why-are-cactus-able-to-survive-in-the-desert>Why are cactus able to survive in the desert?</h2>
<p>A cactus has special adaptations in its roots, leaves as well as stems that enable it to thrive in desert environments. These adaptations include – spines, shallow roots, deep-layer stomata, thick and expandable stem, waxy skin and a short growing season.</p>
<h2 id=can-i-sell-my-saguaro-cactus>Can I sell my saguaro cactus?</h2>
<p>Is it possible to do that? ANSWER: Yes, you can do that, but saguaros are protected native plants and you cannot sell one without first obtaining a permit from the Arizona Department of Agriculture. The permit fee is $7 plus $8 for a tag for the saguaro.</p>
<h2 id=can-you-water-a-saguaro>Can you water a saguaro?</h2>
<p>Due to our drier and hotter climate, water your Saguaro in the summer months. Place a hose about five feet away from the trunk once a month for about 30 minutes. That is all that is needed; no watering in the winter is required. Do not allow water to sit around the base of the cactus for a long period of time.</p>
<h2 id=how-much-is-a-saguaro-cactus-worth>How much is a saguaro cactus worth?</h2>
<p>HOW MUCH DOES A CACTUS COST? Saguaro cactus costs about $100 per foot, with average prices ranging from $20 to $2,000 in the US for 2020 according to DFRanchandGardens. osieOnTheHouse says, “The smaller the saguaro, the less it will cost.</p>
<h2 id=how-are-cactus-plants-adapted-to-live-in-the-desert>How are cactus plants adapted to live in the desert?</h2>
<p>The dense network of spines provides shed to the stem of the plant, keeping it cooler than the surrounding air. This is an interesting characteristic that ensures that cacti plants don’t lose water to the surrounding hot and dry air. Water is a basic need for any living organism.</p>
<h2 id=what-do-you-need-to-know-about-the-saguaro-cactus>What do you need to know about the saguaro cactus?</h2>
<p>Saguaros like it hot, so they aren’t typically found at elevations above 4,000 feet. 4. The saguaro is adapted to make the most of every drop of rain. The cactus has a single deep taproot—the rest of its roots grow close to the surface of the ground in order to absorb as much water as possible before it evaporates.</p>
<h2 id=which-is-the-largest-cactus-in-the-desert>Which is the largest cactus in the desert?</h2>
<p>The saguaro cactus is the largest of any cactus to grow in the desert biome. These flowering plants also bloom in the desert between April and June. Large white trumpet-like flowers attract pollinators such as honeybees and hummingbirds. Although these cacti grow up to 52 ft. (16 m), they are slow-growing plants.</p>
<h2 id=why-is-the-saguaro-cactus-at-risk-for-wildfire>Why is the saguaro cactus at risk for wildfire?</h2>
<p>The cactus is also at risk from introduced species like buffelgrass, which elevates the risk of wildfire and threatens to crowd out young saguaros. The National Park Service and local volunteer groups seek and destroy buffelgrass infestations by pulling up the plant from its roots by hand.</p>
