<h2 id=what-was-the-significance-of-worcester-vs-georgia>What was the significance of Worcester vs Georgia?</h2>
<p>Worcester v. Georgia was a landmark case of the Supreme Court. Although it did not prevent the Cherokee from being removed from their land, the decision was often used to craft subsequent Indian law in the United States.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-worcester-v-georgia-quizlet>What was Worcester v. Georgia quizlet?</h2>
<p>On appeal their case reached the Supreme Court as Worcester v. Georgia (1832), and the Court held that the Cherokee Nation was “a distinct political community” within which Georgia law had no force. The Georgia law was therefore unconstitutional. A leading attorney who argued many famous cases in the Supreme Court.</p>
<h2 id=what-did-andrew-jackson-think-of-worcester-v-georgia>What did Andrew Jackson think of Worcester v. Georgia?</h2>
<p>Other legal conflicts surfaced. Jackson allegedly defied the Supreme Court over Worcester v. Georgia (1832), announcing, “John Marshall has made his decision now let him enforce it.” The case revolved around Georgia’s attempt to apply state laws to Cherokee lands.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-georgia-react-to-the-supreme-court-decision-in-worcester-v-georgia-quizlet>How did Georgia react to the Supreme Court decision in Worcester v. Georgia quizlet?</h2>
<p>The Supreme Court ruled that the Cherokee nation was a distance community in which the laws of Georgia had no force. Only the federal government had control over the Native Americans. Georgia ignored the Court’s ruling and Jackson did not enforce the Court’s ruling. Congress did not protest either.</p>
<h2 id=what-did-andrew-jackson-do-that-was-unconstitutional>What did Andrew Jackson do that was unconstitutional?</h2>
<p>On December 10, 1832, President Andrew Jackson issued the Nullification Proclamation, which stated that states and municipalities are forbidden from nullifying federal laws. Believing the tariff to be unconstitutional, South Carolinians articulated a route by which they themselves could declare a law unconstitutional.</p>
<h2 id=what-did-the-supreme-court-decide-in-worcester-v-georgia>What did the Supreme Court decide in Worcester v Georgia?</h2>
<p>Worcester and the missionaries were convicted of violating the law. The Supreme Court, on a writ of error, reversed the convictions. Because the U.S. government has the exclusive authority to regulate intercourse with the Cherokee nation, Georgia’s law was unconstitutional and, therefore, void. Worcester v. Georgia Case Brief</p>
<h2 id=when-did-worcester-and-butler-refuse-to-leave-georgia>When did Worcester and Butler refuse to leave Georgia?</h2>
<p>Several missionaries, including Worcester and Butler, decided to challenge the law and refused to leave the state. On March 12, 1831, Georgia authorities arrested Worcester, Butler, and several other missionaries and teachers for violating the new law.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-outcome-of-the-cherokee-v-worcester-case>What was the outcome of the Cherokee V Worcester case?</h2>
<p>Worcester legally established that the Cherokee Nation was sovereign. It could be reasonably argued, therefore, that the Indian Removal Act was invalid, illegal, unconstitutional, and against treaties previously made by the United States. But that only matters if the men with the guns and the horses agree see it that way as well, and they didn’t.</p>
<h2 id=why-did-the-georgia-case-go-to-the-us-supreme-court>Why did the Georgia case go to the US Supreme Court?</h2>
<p>Accordingly, Georgia’s laws are in conflict and must yield to the Constitution of the United States. As a jurisdictional matter, the case should not have come to the U.S. Supreme Court on a writ of error. Rather, it should have been returned by the State court.</p>
