<h2 id=why-was-the-caerphilly-castle-built>Why was the Caerphilly Castle built?</h2>
<p>The castle was constructed by Gilbert de Clare in the 13th century as part of his campaign to maintain control of Glamorgan, and saw extensive fighting between Gilbert, his descendants, and the native Welsh rulers. …</p>
<h2 id=is-caerphilly-a-good-place-to-live>Is Caerphilly a good place to live?</h2>
<p>Caerphilly is a commuter’s dream, offering the perfect balance of beautiful countryside and a busy town centre. It is handy for both Cardiff, which is around seven miles away, and Newport, which is 12 miles away.</p>
<h2 id=why-was-the-castle-of-caerphilly-built>Why was the castle of Caerphilly built?</h2>
<p>It was built to defend against Llywelyn ap Gruffydd (‘Llywelyn The Last’), the last Prince of a united Wales before the conquest of Edward I. Llywelyn was largely integrated into British nobility, but had a long-running dispute with de Clare, who built Caerphilly Castle between 1268 and 1271 to defend against him.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-outcome-of-the-attack-on-caerphilly>What was the outcome of the attack on Caerphilly?</h2>
<p>Morgan attacked Caerphilly, burning half of the town, but failed to take the castle. In the spring of 1295 Edward pressed home a counter-attack in North Wales, putting down the uprising and arresting Madog. De Clare attacked Morgan’s forces and retook the region between April and May, resulting in Morgan’s surrender.</p>
<h2 id=where-was-the-roman-fort-in-caerphilly-located>Where was the Roman fort in Caerphilly located?</h2>
<p>The castle was located in the Rhymney valley, in the vicinity of the former Roman fort. Work was imposed on a very fast pace. The architect of the castle and the exact cost of construction are unknown, but modern estimates suggest that it cost the same as the castle in Conwy or Caernarfon, maybe even 19,000 pounds, which was a huge sum at the time.</p>
<h2 id=is-there-a-siege-engine-in-caerphilly-castle>Is there a siege engine in Caerphilly Castle?</h2>
<p>Caerphilly Castle also boasts replica parapets and working siege engines. War enthusiasts and children should certainly take in the medieval siege experience with this full scale, operational weaponry which is always on display and demonstrated for visitors several times per year.</p>
