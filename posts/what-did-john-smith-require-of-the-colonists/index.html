<h2 id=what-did-john-smith-require-of-the-colonists>What did John Smith require of the colonists?</h2>
<p>What did Captain John Smith require of colonists at Jamestown? He made a rule that anyone who did not word did not eat.</p>
<h2 id=what-did-john-smith-tell-the-colonists-who-werent-working>What did John Smith tell the colonists who weren’t working?</h2>
<p>Virginians know that Captain John Smith was vital to the survival of Jamestown in its early years. They can quote his order: “He that will not work shall not eat.” But few know that Smith’s adventures started years before Jamestown.</p>
<h2 id=why-did-john-smith-make-the-jamestown-colonists-work>Why did John Smith make the Jamestown colonists work?</h2>
<p>English soldier John Smith eventually made his way to America to help govern the British colony of Jamestown. After allegedly being saved from death by Pocahontas, he established trading agreements with native tribes.</p>
<h2 id=who-told-the-colonist-in-jamestown-they-must-work-for-food>Who told the colonist in Jamestown They must work for food?</h2>
<p>“Work or Starve” The colony may well have perished had it not been for the leadership of John Smith. He imposed strict discipline on the colonists. “Work or starve” was his motto, and each colonist was required to spend four hours per day farming.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-rule-of-john-smiths-colony>What was the rule of John Smith’s colony?</h2>
<p>Smith demanded that everyone at the settlement work. His rule was “if you don’t work, you don’t eat.” Smith also knew that the colony needed to establish better relations with the Powhatan people, the local Native American tribe. He bravely went to meet with their leader and was captured.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-john-smith-save-the-jamestown-colony>How did John Smith save the Jamestown Colony?</h2>
<p>Jamestown was established in 1607, and Smith trained the first settlers to farm and work, thus saving the colony from early devastation. He publicly stated, ” He that will not work, shall not eat “, alluding to 2 Thessalonians 3:10.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-john-smith-deal-with-the-indians>How did John Smith deal with the Indians?</h2>
<p>Regardless of rank or occupation, everyone worked for the common good or suffered Smith’s wrath, which earned him the enmity of the local gentry. He dealt with the Indians more brazenly, using threats and sometimes force to get corn, which annoyed the Virginia Company of London as well as Chief Powhatan.</p>
<h2 id=what-did-the-virginia-company-give-john-smith>What did the Virginia Company give John Smith?</h2>
<p>Newport brought a list of counterfeit Virginia Company orders which angered Smith greatly. One of the orders was to crown Indian leader Powhatan emperor and give him a fancy bedstead. The Company wanted Smith to pay for Newport’s voyage with pitch, tar, sawed boards, soap ashes, and glass.</p>
