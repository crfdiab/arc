<p>two tributaries<br>
The Nile is composed of two tributaries: the White Nile and the Blue Nile. The White Nile, which is the longer of the two, begins at Lake Victoria in Tanzania and flows north until it reaches Khartoum, Sudan, where it converges with the Blue Nile.</p>
<h2 id=how-many-branches-does-the-nile-have>How many branches does the Nile have?</h2>
<p>North of Cairo, the Nile splits into two branches (or distributaries) that feed the Mediterranean: the Rosetta Branch to the west and the Damietta to the east, forming the Nile Delta.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-the-main-tributaries-of-the-nile-river>What are the main tributaries of the Nile River?</h2>
<p>Its three main tributaries are the White Nile, the Blue Nile, and the Atbara. The soil of the Nile River delta between El Qâhira (Cairo) and the Mediterranean Sea is rich in nutrients, due to the large silt deposits the Nile leaves behind as it flows into the sea.</p>
<h2 id=where-does-the-white-nile-meet-the-nile-river>Where does the White Nile meet the Nile River?</h2>
<p>tributary of the Nile River flowing from Lake Tana in Ethiopia and meeting the White Nile at Khartoum, Sudan, to form the Nile River. to prepare and nurture the land for crops. act in which earth is worn away, often by water, wind, or ice. plant cultivated for its oil, seeds, and fibers, used to make linen. Also called linseed.</p>
<h2 id=why-does-the-nile-river-flood-every-year>Why does the Nile River flood every year?</h2>
<p>In addition, routine annual flooding no longer occurs along parts of the Nile. These floods were necessary to flush and clean the water of human and agricultural waste. As a result, the water is becoming more polluted. The Nile River also continues to be an important trade route, connecting Africa with markets in Europe and beyond.</p>
<h2 id=why-are-the-banks-of-the-nile-river-green>Why are the banks of the Nile River Green?</h2>
<p>The banks of the Nile all along its vast length contain rich soil as well, thanks to annual flooding that deposits silt. From space, the contrast between the Nile’s lush green river banks and the barren desert through which it flows is obvious. For millennia, much of Egypt’s food has been cultivated in the Nile delta region.</p>
