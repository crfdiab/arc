<h2 id=what-happened-to-the-submarine-nautilus>What happened to the submarine NAUTILUS?</h2>
<p>Nautilus was decommissioned in 1980 and designated a National Historic Landmark in 1982. The submarine has been preserved as a museum ship at the Submarine Force Library and Museum in Groton, Connecticut, where the vessel receives around 250,000 visitors per year.</p>
<h2 id=what-happens-to-decommissioned-nuclear-subs>What happens to decommissioned nuclear subs?</h2>
<p>When the nuclear reactors used to power submarines and aircraft carriers are disposed of, the Department of Defense maintains and monitors the radioactive parts. When submarine and aircraft carrier nuclear reactors are no longer being used, the compartments are shipped to the final disposal site on barges.</p>
<h2 id=when-was-the-uss-nautilus-decommissioned>When was the USS Nautilus decommissioned?</h2>
<p>March 3, 1980<br>
After a career spanning 25 years and almost 500,000 miles steamed, the Nautilus was decommissioned on March 3, 1980. Designated a National Historic Landmark in 1982, the world’s first nuclear submarine went on exhibit in 1986 as the Historic Ship Nautilus at the Submarine Force Museum in Groton, Connecticut.</p>
<h2 id=how-long-could-the-uss-nautilus-stay-submerged>How long could the USS Nautilus stay submerged?</h2>
<p>NAUTILUS was the first true submarine and could stay underwater for very long periods of time. Whereas World War II submarines would remain submerged for 12-48 hours. NAUTILUS could remain underwater for two weeks or more.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-captain-nemo-die>How did Captain Nemo die?</h2>
<p>Nemo dies of unspecified natural causes on board the Nautilus, docked permanently inside Dakkar Grotto on Lincoln Island in the South Pacific. Cyrus Smith, leader of the castaways whom Nemo protected, administered the last rites, then submerged the Nautilus in the grotto’s waters.</p>
<h2 id=how-long-can-nuclear-submarines-stay-underwater>How long can nuclear submarines stay underwater?</h2>
<p>Endurance: Nuclear submarines can operate underwater for three or four months at a time and cross oceans with ease. While some conventional submarines can handle the distance, none have comparable underwater endurance.</p>
<h2 id=why-are-cruise-ships-not-nuclear-powered>Why are cruise ships not nuclear powered?</h2>
<p>There are only a few companies capable of building nuclear reactors, hundreds make diesels. Cruise lines want cheap, very cheap labor, and cheap labor doesn’t, and you don’t want them to, work with nuclear reactors. You can get fuel, but is expensive and delivery,refueling all complicated.</p>
<h2 id=is-nautilus-real>Is Nautilus real?</h2>
<p>Nautilus is the fictional submarine belonging to Captain Nemo featured in Jules Verne’s novels Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea (1870) and The Mysterious Island (1874). Verne named the Nautilus after Robert Fulton’s real-life submarine Nautilus (1800).</p>
<h2 id=why-does-nemo-want-revenge>Why does Nemo want revenge?</h2>
<p>Captain Nemo repeatedly mentions that he is seeking revenge for injustices he incurred while on land. Interestingly, the reader must consider that while Nemo’s violence seems senseless and evil, he is not necessarily different from a nation state.</p>
<h2 id=is-captain-nemo-a-bad-guy>Is Captain Nemo a bad guy?</h2>
<p>Captain Nemo is the anti-heroic deuteragonist of the 1870 Jules Verne novel Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea. He later reappears as the benefactor of the castaways in The Mysterious Island.</p>
<h2 id=what-kind-of-reactor-was-the-nautilus-powered-by>What kind of reactor was the Nautilus powered by?</h2>
<p>USS Nautilus was powered by the S2W reactor, and crew were trained on the land-based S1W reactor at INL. The second nuclear submarine was USS Seawolf, which was initially powered by a sodium-cooled S2G reactor, and supported by the land-based S1G reactor at the Kesselring site under Knolls Atomic Power Laboratory operated by General Electric.</p>
<h2 id=when-did-the-uss-nautilus-become-a-museum>When did the USS Nautilus become a museum?</h2>
<p>On March 3, 1980, Nautilus was decommissioned. Two years later, in recognition of the submarine’s unique place in history, it was designated a National Historic Landmark. With this status in place, Nautilus was converted to a museum ship and returned to Groton. It is now part of the US Sub Force Museum.</p>
<h2 id=which-is-the-first-ship-to-use-nuclear-power>Which is the first ship to use nuclear power?</h2>
<p>The STR reactor on the USS Nautilus was started on January 17, 1955 and propelled the USS Nautilus’ maiden voyage, making history for being first “underway on nuclear power.” [2] Fig. 2 shows the USS Nautilus on her maiden voyage and start of her trek to the Arctic. USS Enterprise Fig. 3:The USS Enterprise.</p>
<h2 id=how-are-nuclear-reactors-used-in-a-submarine>How are nuclear reactors used in a submarine?</h2>
<p>According to the National Museum of American History, “Nuclear reactors are basically heat engines. As uranium fissions, the breaking of atoms releases energy, much of it in the form of heat, which can be used to do work. In a nuclear-powered submarine, reactor heat produces steam to drive the turbines that provide the submarine’s actual power.”</p>
