<h2 id=who-was-responsible-for-the-missouri-compromise-and-the-compromise-of-1850>Who was responsible for the Missouri Compromise and the Compromise of 1850?</h2>
<p>Senator Henry Clay of<br>
Senator Henry Clay of Kentucky, a leading statesman and member of the Whig Party known as “The Great Compromiser” for his work on the Missouri Compromise, was the primary creator of the Missouri Compromise.</p>
<h2 id=what-were-the-3-main-conditions-of-the-missouri-compromise>What were the 3 main conditions of the Missouri Compromise?</h2>
<p>The Missouri Compromise consisted of three large parts: Missouri entered the Union as a slave state, Maine entered as a free state, and the 36’30” line was established as the dividing line regarding slavery for the remainder of the Louisiana Territory.</p>
<h2 id=was-the-missouri-compromise-a-good-idea>Was the Missouri Compromise a good idea?</h2>
<p>The South felt that the U.S. government had no power to restrict slavery, which was protected under the Constitution. The second admitted Missouri as a slave state and set the parallel 36°30′ as the dividing line between enslaved and free states as the country continued to expand. This compromise was successful.</p>
<h2 id=why-was-the-missouri-compromise-a-failure>Why was the Missouri Compromise a failure?</h2>
<p>The Missouri Compromise was ineffective in dealing with the issue of slavery because it increased sectionalism between Northern and Southern states. Without an equal balance between slave states and free states, Southern states believed they would lose political power in Congress, especially the Senate.</p>
<h2 id=what-did-the-missouri-compromise-do-to-the-us>What did the Missouri Compromise do to the US?</h2>
<p>Missouri Compromise: Primary Documents in American History Enacted in 1820 to maintain the balance of power in Congress, the Missouri Compromise admitted Missouri as a slave state and Maine as a free state.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-significance-of-the-missouri-compromise>What was the significance of the Missouri Compromise?</h2>
<p>Dred Scott v. Sandford The Missouri Compromise was United States federal legislation that admitted Maine to the United States as a free state, simultaneously with Missouri as a slave state —thus maintaining the balance of power between North and South in the United States Senate.</p>
<h2 id=who-was-the-speaker-of-the-house-during-the-missouri-compromise>Who was the Speaker of the House during the Missouri Compromise?</h2>
<p>The Missouri Compromise dictated that Maine would enter the Union as a free state, and Missouri would enter as a slave state. Henry Clay of Kentucky was Speaker of the House during the debates over the Missouri Compromise and was deeply engaged in moving the legislation forward.</p>
<h2 id=who-was-the-editor-of-the-missouri-compromise>Who was the editor of the Missouri Compromise?</h2>
<p>Robert J. McNamara is a history expert and former magazine journalist. He was Amazon.com’s first-ever history editor and has bylines in New York, the Chicago Tribune, and other national outlets. The Missouri Compromise was the first of the major 19th-century attempts by Congress intended to ease regional tensions over the issue of slavery.</p>
<h2 id=what-did-jesse-b-thomas-add-to-the-missouri-compromise>What did Jesse B Thomas add to the Missouri Compromise?</h2>
<p>Senator Jesse B. Thomas of Illinois added a compromise proviso, excluding slavery from all remaining lands of the Louisiana Purchase north of the 36° 30′ parallel. The combined measures passed the Senate, only to be voted down in the House by those Northern representatives who held out for a free Missouri.</p>
