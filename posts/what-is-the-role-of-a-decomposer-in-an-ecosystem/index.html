<h2 id=what-is-the-role-of-a-decomposer-in-an-ecosystem>What is the role of a decomposer in an ecosystem?</h2>
<p>Decomposers play a critical role in the flow of energy through an ecosystem. They break apart dead organisms into simpler inorganic materials, making nutrients available to primary producers.</p>
<h2 id=which-best-describes-a-decomposer>Which best describes a decomposer?</h2>
<p>Decomposers are made up of the FBI (fungi, bacteria and invertebrates—worms and insects). They are all living things that get energy by eating dead animals and plants and breaking down wastes of other animals.</p>
<h2 id=which-statement-describes-the-role-of-decomposers-in-a-food-web>Which statement describes the role of decomposers in a food web?</h2>
<p>Answer: Every part of an ecosystem is vital to its survival – from the green plants to furry animals and microscopic bacteria. The group of organisms called decomposers forms the final link in the food chain. They break down dead animals and plants and return vital nutrients to the soil.</p>
<h2 id=which-answer-best-describes-the-role-of-a-decomposer>Which answer best describes the role of a decomposer?</h2>
<p>Q. Which best describes the role of decomposers in an ecosystem? Decomposers eat consumers and pass along energy. Decomposers eat scavengers and pass along energy.</p>
<h2 id=which-is-an-example-of-a-decomposer>Which is an example of a decomposer?</h2>
<p>Examples of decomposers are fungi and bacteria that obtain their nutrients from a dead plant or animal material. They break down the cells of dead organisms into simpler substances, which become organic nutrients available to the ecosystem.</p>
<h2 id=which-statement-best-describes-how-decomposers-get-the-food-they-need-to-survive>Which statement best describes how decomposers get the food they need to survive?</h2>
<p>Grade 7 Food Chains and Webs Which statement best describes how decomposers get the food they need to survive? They eat other organisms. They obtain energy and food from the chemicals in their environment. They use energy from the sun to make food from water and carbon dioxide.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-the-most-important-decomposers-in-an-ecosystem>What are the most important decomposers in an ecosystem?</h2>
<p>Bacteria and fungi do the majority of decomposition work. Worms and maggots also help. Fungi work mainly on plant materials, breaking down even cellulose and lignin, the largest of the complex carbohydrates.</p>
<h2 id=what-happens-to-decomposers-when-plants-and-animals-die>What happens to decomposers when plants and animals die?</h2>
<p>When animals eat plants, those simple sugars and carbohydrates are broken down and used as the building blocks for animal fats, carbohydrates and proteins. When plants and animals die, those large complex compounds cannot be directly used again. Instead the decomposers break them down and make them available.</p>
<h2 id=how-are-producers-and-consumers-related-in-an-ecosystem>How are producers and consumers related in an ecosystem?</h2>
<p>A producer supplies energy for the consumers in the ecosystem b. a producer supplies light for the consumers in the ecosystem. c. a producer supplies water for the consumer in the ecosystem. d. a producer supplies oxygen for the consumer in the ecosystem.</p>
<h2 id=how-are-carbon-dioxide-and-nitrogen-recycled-in-an-ecosystem>How are carbon dioxide and nitrogen recycled in an ecosystem?</h2>
<p>Carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen and the other necessary elements of life are all recycled. The oxygen we breathe in today was once breathed in by dinosaurs. The carbon dioxide that we breathe out is used by plants to create sugars in the process of photosynthesis.</p>
