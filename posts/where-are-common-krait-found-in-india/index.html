<h2 id=where-are-common-krait-found-in-india>Where are common krait found in India?</h2>
<p>Distribution and habitat This common krait is distributed from Sindh to West Bengal, throughout South India and Sri Lanka at elevations up to about 1,600 m (5,200 ft). It has also been recorded in Afghanistan, Bangladesh, and Nepal.</p>
<h2 id=where-does-the-common-krait-live>Where does the common krait live?</h2>
<p>Common kraits are distributed from Sindh to West Bengal, throughout South India and Sri Lanka. They have also been recorded in Afghanistan, Bangladesh, and Nepal. These snakes live in a wide variety of habitats, from fields and low scrub jungle, as well as settled areas.</p>
<h2 id=is-common-krait-found-in-india>Is common krait found in India?</h2>
<p>The common krait, also known as Indian krait or blue krait, is a species of highly-venomous snake found on the Indian subcontinent. It is a member of the ‘big four’ species, inflicting the most snakebites on humans in Bangladesh and India.</p>
<h2 id=how-fast-can-a-common-krait-kill-you>How fast can a common krait kill you?</h2>
<p>On comparison with cobra bite, which can kill a man in 30 minutes, the progression of envenoming may be slow in an occasional case of krait bite.</p>
<h2 id=is-common-krait-aggressive>Is common krait aggressive?</h2>
<p>Kraits are ophiophagous, preying primarily upon other snakes (including venomous varieties) and are cannibalistic, feeding on other kraits. All kraits are nocturnal. They are more docile during the daylight; at night, they become very active, but are not very aggressive even when provoked.</p>
<h2 id=how-dangerous-is-a-common-krait>How dangerous is a common krait?</h2>
<p>An untreated Common Krait bite has a mortality rate of 70 to 80%, and death can occur in as little as 4 to 5 hours after the bite. These nocturnal snakes are active at night and are seldom encountered by humans during the day so most bite incidents occur at night.</p>
<h2 id=are-kraits-aggressive>Are Kraits aggressive?</h2>
<h2 id=is-common-krait-dangerous>Is common krait dangerous?</h2>
<p>They are terrestrial, feeding mainly on other snakes but also on frogs, lizards, and small mammals. Kraits are nocturnal hunters and are dangerous to humans only when stepped on or otherwise strongly provoked.</p>
<h2 id=are-kraits-aggressive-1>Are kraits aggressive?</h2>
<h2 id=which-snake-has-no-anti-venom>Which snake has no anti-venom?</h2>
<p>About 60 of the 270 snake species found in India are medically important. This includes various types of cobras, kraits, saw-scaled vipers, sea snakes, and pit vipers for which there are no commercially available anti-venom.</p>
<h2 id=what-kind-of-habitat-does-a-krait-live-in>What kind of habitat does a krait live in?</h2>
<p>It lives in a wide variety of habitats, from fields and low scrub jungle, as well as settled areas. It rests in termite mounds, brick piles, rat holes, even inside houses.</p>
<h2 id=is-it-possible-to-get-bit-by-a-krait-in-india>Is it possible to get bit by a krait in India?</h2>
<p>Kraits are nocturnal creatures; therefore the risk of being bitten by a krait is highly increased at night. Krait envenomation is quite common in India, Taiwan, Vietnam, and other Asian countries. In a study by Ha (2009) 1, 60 krait envenomations were studied.</p>
<h2 id=what-kind-of-snake-is-the-common-krait>What kind of snake is the common krait?</h2>
<p>“Dangerous” is the most frequent label used to describe the common krait. This snake has the reputation of being the deadliest snake within its geographical distribution, and all snakes that look remotely like it also suffer because of this. However, the common krait ( Bungarus caeruleus) has done little to earn this reputation.</p>
<h2 id=what-kind-of-animals-does-the-common-krait-eat>What kind of animals does the common krait eat?</h2>
<p>The common krait feeds primarily on other snakes, including: “blind worms” (snakes of the genus Typhlops ); and cannibalizes on other kraits, including the young. It also feeds on small mammals (such as rats, and mice ), lizards and frogs.</p>
