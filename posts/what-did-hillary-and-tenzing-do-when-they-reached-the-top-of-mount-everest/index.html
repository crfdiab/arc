<h2 id=what-did-hillary-and-tenzing-do-when-they-reached-the-top-of-mount-everest>What did Hillary and Tenzing do when they reached the top of Mount Everest?</h2>
<p>29 May 1953 On 29 May – four days before the coronation of Queen Elizabeth II – the chosen pair, Hillary and the experienced Tenzing, reached the 8848-m summit of Mt Everest via the south-east ridge. In the 1960s Hillary returned to the Himalayas to help build schools and health facilities for the sherpas of Nepal.</p>
<h2 id=why-did-hillary-and-sherpa-signed-the-agreement>Why did Hillary and Sherpa signed the agreement?</h2>
<p>According to a memo found in the archives of the Royal Geographical Society, Colonel James Hunt – who led the expedition – and Christopher Summerhayes – the British ambassador to Nepal – doctored the official account in order to conceal who got to the peak first and made the decision to share the credit between both …</p>
<h2 id=how-were-the-first-climbers-rewarded>How were the first climbers rewarded?</h2>
<p>Hillary and Hunt were given kukris in jewelled sheaths, while the other members received jewelled caskets. The same day, the Indian government announced the creation of a new Gold Medal, an award for civilian gallantry modelled on the George Medal, of which Hunt, Hillary and Tenzing would be the first recipients.</p>
<h2 id=did-hillary-and-tenzing-remain-friends>Did Hillary and Tenzing remain friends?</h2>
<p>Sixty years ago New Zealander Edmund Hillary and Sherpa Tenzing Norgay made it to the top of the world. While Hillary claimed that he and Norgay reached the summit together, Norgay claimed Hillary was up there first. However it happened, the men remained lifelong friends.</p>
<h2 id=what-did-edmund-hillary-do-at-the-top-of-mt-everest>What did Edmund Hillary do at the top of Mt Everest?</h2>
<p>When they reached the top, Hillary placed a small cross in the snow and Norgay left a Buddhist offering of chocolates. Hillary took a picture of Norgay posing at the peak with his ice ax, but he didn’t ask Norgay to take one of him.</p>
<h2 id=who-was-the-second-person-to-climb-mount-everest>Who was the second person to climb Mount Everest?</h2>
<p>On 27 May, the expedition made its second assault on the summit with the second climbing pair, the New Zealander Edmund Hillary and Sherpa Tenzing Norgay from Nepal. Norgay had previously ascended to a record high point on Everest as a member of the Swiss expedition of 1952.</p>
<h2 id=when-did-hillary-and-norgay-reach-the-top-of-everest>When did Hillary and Norgay reach the top of Everest?</h2>
<p>Hillary threw down a rope, and Norgay followed. At about 11:30 a.m., the climbers arrived at the top of the world.</p>

<p>Hillary and Norgay made it to the top — and back to the bottom — thanks in part to their ego-free camaraderie and seamless teamwork, according to the Welsh writer Jan Morris, who accompanied the 1953 British Everest Expedition, which supported the pair on their quest for the summit.</p>
