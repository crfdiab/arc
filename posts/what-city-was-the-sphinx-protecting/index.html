<p>of Thebes<br>
The Sphinx is said to have guarded the entrance to the Greek city of Thebes, asking a riddle to travellers to allow them passage.</p>
<h2 id=in-what-city-is-the-great-pyramid>In what city is the Great Pyramid?</h2>
<p>The Great Pyramid of Giza (also known as the Pyramid of Khufu or the Pyramid of Cheops) is the oldest and largest of the pyramids in the Giza pyramid complex bordering present-day Giza in Greater Cairo, Egypt. It is the oldest of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World, and the only one to remain largely intact.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-symbol-of-the-sphinx>What is the symbol of the Sphinx?</h2>
<p>The familiar depiction of the sphinx of ancient Egyptian culture is a creature with the body of a lion and the head of a man. Historians interpret this mixed form as a symbolic joining of a lion’s strength and dominance to a king’s intelligence.</p>
<h2 id=where-is-the-sphinx-located-in-the-world>Where is the sphinx located in the world?</h2>
<p>A: The Sphinx is located in Giza, Egypt. The Sphinx is situated on the west bank of the Nile River on the Giza Plateau. It is the largest monolith statue in the world and is over 60 feet high, 241 feet long and 63 feet wide.</p>
<h2 id=how-tall-is-the-great-sphinx-in-feet>How tall is the Great Sphinx in feet?</h2>
<p>The Sphinx, which lies south of the Great Pyramid, is around 24 feet in length and 66 feet in height. The Great Sphinx is the most famous artistic rendition of a sphinx. It is also the earliest surviving example, dating back to the third century B.C.</p>
<h2 id=is-there-a-temple-in-front-of-the-sphinx>Is there a temple in front of the Sphinx?</h2>
<p>In the early 1900s, French archaeologist Emile Baraize dug up another building (the Sphinx Temple) directly in front of the Sphinx that’s similar in design to the Valley Temple.</p>
<h2 id=is-there-a-sphinx-in-the-metropolitan-museum-of-art>Is there a sphinx in the Metropolitan Museum of Art?</h2>
<p>Besides the Great Sphinx, other famous Egyptian sphinxes include one bearing the head of the pharaoh Hatshepsut, with her likeness carved in granite, which is now in the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York, and the alabaster Sphinx of Memphis, currently located within the open-air museum at that site.</p>
