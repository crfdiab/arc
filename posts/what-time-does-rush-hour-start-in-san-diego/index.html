<h2 id=what-time-does-rush-hour-start-in-san-diego>What time does rush hour start in San Diego?</h2>
<p>The average rush hour time is 6:30 am to 8:30 am. Evening commute maybe 4:00 pm until 6:30 pm. Give or take, but this is usually San Diego’s busiest freeway times.</p>
<h2 id=is-traffic-bad-in-san-diego>Is traffic bad in San Diego?</h2>
<p>Traffic. Gridlock isn’t quite as bad in San Diego as it is in Los Angeles or the Bay Area, but the city is not without congestion problems. Rush hour is a misnomer because it lasts much longer than 60 minutes.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-best-time-of-day-to-drive-from-san-diego-to-los-angeles>What is the best time of day to drive from San Diego to Los Angeles?</h2>
<p>If you want to deal with as little traffic as possible, you should take your drive through LA between 10am and 1pm, and try to arrive at your San Diego destination before 4pm. We advise you to depart from LA between 10am and 11am.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-best-time-to-avoid-traffic-in-la>What is the best time to avoid traffic in LA?</h2>
<p>The best LA traffic times to avoid are before 7:30 am, and at anytime between 9:30 am – 3:45 pm. At these times, you’ll be able to head home much more quickly. See if you can work out a schedule with your boss so you can avoid Los Angeles rush hour.</p>
<h2 id=what-day-of-the-week-has-the-least-traffic>What day of the week has the least traffic?</h2>
<p>Mondays and Fridays usually have a little lower traffic demands due to flexible work or school schedules and people taking an extra day off for an extended weekend. “Those days with higher traffic demands also mean a higher likelihood for stalls and accidents, both of which cause increased congestion.”</p>
<h2 id=what-time-is-traffic-the-best>What time is traffic the best?</h2>
<p>THE BEST & WORST EVENING COMMUTES The data showed that, across the board, traffic is smoothest on Monday evening. All 18 freeway segments analyzed showed vehicles moving fastest that day between 5 and 7 p.m.</p>
<h2 id=why-is-the-405-so-bad>Why is the 405 so bad?</h2>
<p>The freeway’s congestion problems are legendary, leading to jokes that the road was numbered 405 because traffic moves at “four or five” miles per hour, or because drivers had spent “four or five” hours to travel anywhere.</p>
<h2 id=what-time-is-la-traffic-the-worst-in-the-morning>What time is LA traffic the worst in the morning?</h2>
<p>Traffic: LA Rush Hour Traffic is usually heavy on the freeways during morning and evening commutes when you’re driving in Los Angeles. Weekday morning LA rush hour is roughly from 7 a.m. to 10 a.m. The evening LA rush hours are around 4 p.m. to 7 p.m. and later.</p>
<h2 id=why-is-la-traffic-so-bad>Why is LA traffic so bad?</h2>
<p>LA has a lot of traffic because it has a large population spread over a large land area, lousy public transportation, lots of cars, and just a couple of main highways to move people north and south.</p>
<h2 id=when-is-the-best-time-to-drive-into-san-diego>When is the best time to drive into San Diego?</h2>

<h2 id=when-is-the-heaviest-traffic-in-san-diego>When is the heaviest traffic in San Diego?</h2>
<p>Interstate 5 tends to be heavy going Southbound from Carlsbadto San Diego Mission Bayarea in the mornings (say 6 to 10 AM). In the evenings it is mainly Northbound, so you should be fine.</p>
<h2 id=where-is-soledad-mountain-road-in-san-diego>Where is Soledad Mountain Road in San Diego?</h2>
<p>Follow Crown Point Drive and turn left at Lamont Street, which traverses the residential areas of Crown Point and Pacific Beach. At the intersection of Beryl Street, the name will change to Soledad Road. Drive up the hill past Kate Sessions Park (which has a nice playground) and turn left onto Soledad Mountain Road.</p>
