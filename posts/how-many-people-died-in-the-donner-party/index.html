<p>42 people<br>
On February 2, 1847, the first woman of a group of pioneers commonly known as the Donner Party dies during the group’s journey through a Sierra Nevada mountain pass. The disastrous trip west ended up killing 42 people and turned many of the survivors into cannibals.</p>
<h2 id=who-died-of-overeating-in-the-donner-party>Who died of overeating in the Donner Party?</h2>
<p>Towards the end of the journey, Mrs. Keseberg’s four-year old daughter Ada died during a cold night. On another night, William Hook, who was Jacob Donner’s stepson, secretly stole from the camp’s supply of food, and ate until he died from overeating.</p>
<h2 id=did-anyone-survive-from-the-donner-party>Did anyone survive from the Donner Party?</h2>
<p>Of the 81 pioneers who began the Donner Party’s horrific winter in the Sierra Nevada, only 45 managed to walk out alive. The ordeal proved particularly costly for the group’s 15 solo travelers, all but two of whom died, but it also took a tragic toll on the families.</p>

<p>Nearly half never left alive. And up to 200 descendants are expected to gather in August in Truckee and Reno, Nev., for what’s being billed as the year’s premier event California Trail Days 96 and the Donner Party Sesquicentennial.</p>

<p>19th-century group of American migrants, trapped in the Sierra Nevada mountains and forced to resort to cannibalism. For other uses, see Donner Party (disambiguation).</p>
<h2 id=how-did-the-donner-party-survive-on-the-oregon-trail>How did the Donner Party survive on the Oregon Trail?</h2>
<p>Some of the migrants resorted to cannibalism to survive, eating the bodies of those who had succumbed to starvation and sickness. The Donner Party departed Missouri on the Oregon Trail in the spring of 1846, behind many other pioneer families who were attempting to make the same overland trip.</p>

<p>Rescuers from California attempted to reach the migrants, but the first relief party did not arrive until the middle of February 1847, almost four months after the wagon train became trapped. Of the 87 members of the party, 48 survived the ordeal.</p>
