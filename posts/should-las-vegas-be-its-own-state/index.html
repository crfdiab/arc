<h2 id=should-las-vegas-be-its-own-state>Should Las Vegas be its own state?</h2>
<p>The United States of America is comprised of 50 separate states. One of those states is called Nevada. Nevada officially became a state in 1864 and is located in the southwestern part of the country….Las Vegas is Made Up of More Than Just One City.</p>

<h2 id=is-clark-county-in-las-vegas-safe>Is Clark County in Las Vegas safe?</h2>
<p>Clark County rarely has any problems and the crime rate is low. Even though some occurrences happen here and there, metro police are always are on the scene of the crime in a timely manner. I would recommend Clark County to new residents of Las Vegas.</p>
<h2 id=is-all-of-las-vegas-in-clark-county>Is all of Las Vegas in Clark County?</h2>
<p>Las Vegas (/lɒsˈveɪɡəs/; Spanish for “The Meadows”), officially the City of Las Vegas and often known simply as Vegas, is the 25th-most populous city in the United States, the most populous city in the state of Nevada, and the county seat of Clark County….</p>

<h2 id=is-las-vegas-in-unincorporated-clark-county>Is Las Vegas in unincorporated Clark County?</h2>
<p>Clark County comprises of 6 jurisdictions, each with its own licensing agency – the City of Henderson, the City of Las Vegas, the City of North Las Vegas, Boulder City, the City of Mesquite and Unincorporated Clark County.</p>
<h2 id=do-i-need-a-clark-county-business-license>Do I need a Clark County business license?</h2>
<p>Any person who wishes to operate a business in Unincorporated Clark County is required by Clark County Code to obtain a business license. You may also apply for a general license online.</p>
<h2 id=when-did-las-vegas-merge-with-clark-county>When did Las Vegas merge with Clark County?</h2>
<p>Many argued for incorporation of areas in the county because it had become so urbanized and should be serviced by a municipal government. In 1973, the Nevada Legislature passed Senate Bill 340, which disbanded Clark County and Las Vegas’ law enforcement agencies and consolidated them into what is known today as Metro.</p>
<h2 id=whats-the-difference-between-clark-county-and-las-vegas>What’s the difference between Clark County and Las Vegas?</h2>
<p>“This is the only state I know of where people give up seats on the legislature to go serve on county commission.” In most other states, Green said, county government directly serves unincorporated populations in rural communities. Clark County, on the other hand, is much more urban.</p>
<h2 id=why-is-clark-county-the-most-powerful-county-in-nevada>Why is Clark County the most powerful County in Nevada?</h2>
<p>This puts Clark County in an unusual position of power, said UNLV historian Michael Green. “Because the county has the Strip, that gives the county government so much more power than frankly any other body in the state of Nevada,” he said.</p>
<h2 id=are-there-any-unincorporated-towns-in-las-vegas>Are there any unincorporated towns in Las Vegas?</h2>
<p>Winchester, Enterprise, Spring Valley, Sunrise Manor and Whitney, which are often mistakenly thought to reside within Las Vegas city limits, are actually unincorporated towns within Las Vegas Township. And unincorporated Clark County is large.</p>
