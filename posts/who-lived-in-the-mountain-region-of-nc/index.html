<h2 id=who-lived-in-the-mountain-region-of-nc>Who lived in the mountain region of NC?</h2>
<p>Among these early settlers were the Davidsons, Alexanders, Gudgers, and Pattons. As more Whites immigrated into the area just west of the Blue Ridge Mountains in the late 1700s, the Cherokee who were living there moved west.</p>
<h2 id=who-are-mountains-important>Who are mountains important?</h2>
<p>Mountains aren’t just a sight to behold—they cover 22 percent of the planet’s land surface and provide habitat for plants, animals and about 1 billion human beings. The vital landforms also supply critical resources such as fresh water, food and even renewable energy.</p>
<h2 id=who-are-the-people-of-the-rocky-mountains>Who are the people of the Rocky Mountains?</h2>
<p>American Indian peoples inhabiting the northern mountains in modern times include the Shuswap and Kutenai of British Columbia, the Coeur d’Alene and Nez Percé of Idaho, and the Flathead of Montana. The traditional lands of the Shoshone in Idaho and Wyoming and the Ute in Utah and Colorado extended into the west-central ranges.</p>
<h2 id=who-are-the-people-of-the-great-smoky-mountains>Who are the people of the Great Smoky Mountains?</h2>
<p>When the first white settlers reached the Great Smoky Mountains in the late 1700s they found themselves in the land of the Cherokee Indians. The tribe, one of the most culturally advanced on the continent, had permanent towns, cultivated croplands, sophisticated political systems, and extensive networks of trails.</p>

<p>They provide human beings with medicinal products, food, biodiversity, energy and freshwater. Mountains provide home for 720 million people, according to the United Nations Development Programme. Billions of people living in lowlands benefit from mountains. They are the sources of both major and small rivers on Earth.</p>
