<h2 id=can-one-parent-take-a-child-to-mexico>Can one parent take a child to Mexico?</h2>
<p>They must carry a letter from the parents authorizing travel into Mexico. The letter must be translated into Spanish and legalized by the Mexican embassy or consulate in the country where the document was issued. A letter is not required in the case of a child traveling with only one parent.</p>
<h2 id=can-i-get-mexican-citizenship-if-my-parents-are-mexican>Can I get Mexican citizenship if my parents are Mexican?</h2>
<p>Can I obtain citizenship through descent or ancestry? Yes. Children of Mexican citizens are eligible to apply for Mexican citizenship and aren’t required to become permanent residents first if they’re claiming citizenship through parents.</p>
<h2 id=can-i-take-my-son-to-mexico-without-his-dad>Can I take my son to Mexico without his dad?</h2>
<p>In order to prevent international child abductions, Mexican law requires that minors traveling without their parents, or with only one parent, present proof that they have their parents’ authorization for travel. They should carry a notarized letter from the absent parent or parents authorizing travel into Mexico.</p>
<h2 id=can-i-travel-with-my-baby-without-the-father>Can I travel with my baby without the father?</h2>
<p>U.S. Customs and Border Protection recommends that any child traveling without both custodial parents have proof of parental consent to travel.</p>
<h2 id=can-i-be-a-dual-citizen-of-the-us-and-mexico>Can I be a dual citizen of the US and Mexico?</h2>
<p>U.S. law does not mention dual nationality or require a person to choose one nationality or another. A U.S. citizen may naturalize in a foreign state without any risk to his or her U.S. citizenship. The naturalization process in Mexico is managed by the Secretaría de Relaciones Exteriores (SRE).</p>
<h2 id=what-do-you-call-someone-born-in-mexico>What do you call someone born in Mexico?</h2>
<p>The term Mexican (mexicano ) can be used to refer to someone born in Mexico, someone with Mexican citizenship, or someone of Mexican descent.</p>
<h2 id=do-you-have-to-have-a-parent-to-become-a-mexican-citizen>Do you have to have a parent to become a Mexican citizen?</h2>
<p>Hello Margarita, yes these are the requirements to become a Mexican citizen, but only if at least one of your parents is a Mexican citizen. If you do not have a Mexican parent, you might be interested in this article. ?</p>
<h2 id=can-a-foreign-parent-take-custody-of-a-mexican-child>Can a foreign parent take custody of a Mexican child?</h2>
<p>Once a child is recognized, the marital status of the parents does not affect custody of the children. By law, both parents have all the rights, obligations and responsibilities regardless of their marital status. In the event a foreign parent passes away, is it possible for a foreign family member to take the child back to their country?</p>
<h2 id=can-a-child-have-dual-citizenship-in-mexico>Can a child have dual citizenship in Mexico?</h2>
<p>Yes, no matter what nationality the parents are the child will be a Mexican citizen and may apply to have duel citizenship with the country his/her parents are from. Divorce and children, how is child custody managed in Mexico? The parent who takes care of the children will stay in the family home with the children.</p>
