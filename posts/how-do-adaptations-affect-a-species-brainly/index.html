<h2 id=how-do-adaptations-affect-a-species-brainly>How do adaptations affect a species Brainly?</h2>
<p>Answer: Adaptations helps the organism to have genetic variability. Explanation: Adaptations help the organism to survive in the extreme conditions. This is because there is something special in the body of the organism that helps in living the life more smoothly.</p>
<h2 id=how-does-an-adaptation-help-a-species>How does an adaptation help a species?</h2>
<p>In evolutionary theory, adaptation is the biological mechanism by which organisms adjust to new environments or to changes in their current environment. This enables better survival and reproduction compared with other members of the species, leading to evolution.</p>
<h2 id=how-does-adaptation-affect-the-survival-of-a-species>How does adaptation affect the survival of a species?</h2>
<p>Every organism has a unique ecosystem within which it lives. All organisms need to adapt to their habitat to be able to survive. This means adapting to be able to survive the climatic conditions of the ecosystem, predators, and other species that compete for the same food and space.</p>
<h2 id=how-do-adaptations-affect-a-species-brainly-apex>How do adaptations affect a species Brainly apex?</h2>
<p>Answer: They make the species more genetically diverse.</p>
<h2 id=how-do-adaptations-affect-a-species-answers>How do adaptations affect a species answers?</h2>
<p>Adaptations affect a species because it affects where they live and how well they survive and reproduce in their habitats. Adaptations are responsible for making the species more genetically diverse. The evolution of organisms was connected with adaptation of organisms to changing environmental conditions.</p>
<h2 id=which-is-true-about-adaptations>Which is true about adaptations?</h2>
<p>an adaptation is a genetic change overtime that makes an organism better suited to their environment. A is not true because they are not learned, they are naturally acquired through mutations or genetic recombinations.</p>
<h2 id=where-do-adaptations-come-from>Where do adaptations come from?</h2>
<p>Adaptations are the result of evolution. Evolution is a change in a species over long periods of time. Adaptations usually occur because a gene mutates or changes by accident! Some mutations can help an animal or plant survive better than others in the species without the mutation.</p>
<h2 id=how-does-adaptation-affect-the-health-of-an-ecosystem>How does adaptation affect the health of an ecosystem?</h2>
<p>What could potentially occur is a species establishes an adaptation in which the population of said species could increase, thus destabilizing the natural balance of consumers of all trophic levels within that ecosystem.</p>
<h2 id=how-does-adaptation-affect-the-diversity-of-an-ecosystem>How does adaptation affect the diversity of an ecosystem?</h2>
<p>By being able to adapt to the changing environment, organisms are better able to survive and reproduce. These populations have great disparities in terms of their thermal tolerance and their ability to adapt to a new thermal tolerance.</p>
<h2 id=which-would-be-an-adaptation-in-a-rainforest-but-not-a-desert>Which would be an adaptation in a rainforest but not a desert?</h2>
<p>Answer: Skin that blends in with green plants.</p>
<p>More adaptive characters means better survival rates. So well adapted organisms live longer, get chance to produce more offspring and the species as a whole becomes successful. Adaptations are not only morphological/anatomical/physiological in nature, there could be behavioural adaptations as well in animals.</p>
<h2 id=how-does-a-well-adapted-organism-live-longer>How does a well adapted organism live longer?</h2>
<p>So well adapted organisms live longer, get chance to produce more offspring and the species as a whole becomes successful. Adaptations are not only morphological/anatomical/physiological in nature, there could be behavioural adaptations as well in animals. In absence of adaptive features, the species will struggle to survive. Biology</p>
<h2 id=how-is-adaptation-passed-from-generation-to-generation>How is adaptation passed from generation to generation?</h2>
<p>An adaptation is passed from generation to generation. process in which many species develop from the same ancestral species to fill a variety of different roles in the environment. (singular: alga) diverse group of aquatic organisms, the largest of which are seaweeds. region at Earth’s extreme north, encompassed by the Arctic Circle.</p>
<h2 id=which-is-an-example-of-a-structural-adaptation>Which is an example of a structural adaptation?</h2>
<p>An adaptation can also be behavioral, affecting the way an organism responds to its environment. An example of a structural adaptation is the way some plants have adapted to life in dry, hot deserts. Plants called succulents have adapted to this climate by storing water in their short, thick stems and leaves.</p>
