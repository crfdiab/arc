<h2 id=what-materials-make-up-asteroid-belt>What materials make up asteroid belt?</h2>
<p>Most of the asteroids in the Main Belt are made of rock and stone, but a small portion of them contain iron and nickel metals. The remaining asteroids are made up of a mix of these, along with carbon-rich materials. Some of the more distant asteroids tend to contain more ices.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-the-four-objects-that-make-50-of-asteroid-belt>What are the four objects that make 50% of asteroid belt?</h2>
<p>4: The Asteroid Belt is made up of billions of bodies. Most of them are as small as pebbles. The four largest of the bunch (over 250 miles in diameter) are Ceres, Pallas, Vesta, and Hygiea. Together, these four asteroids contain 50% of the belt’s entire mass.</p>
<h2 id=do-asteroids-ever-hit-earth>Do asteroids ever hit Earth?</h2>
<p>Asteroids with a 1 km (0.62 mi) diameter strike Earth every 500,000 years on average. Large collisions – with 5 km (3 mi) objects – happen approximately once every twenty million years.</p>
<h2 id=do-asteroids-pose-a-threat-to-earth>Do asteroids pose a threat to Earth?</h2>
<p>Most of the asteroids and comets in our solar system do not pose any danger to our planet. But, for every thousand or so of those objects there is one with an orbit crosses that of Earth, posing the possibility of a collision at some future time.</p>
<h2 id=how-are-asteroids-made-for-kids>How are asteroids made for kids?</h2>
<p>They are also called minor planets or planetoids. In general, they are materials left over from when the planets formed. They are also created when other bodies in space collide and break apart. Most asteroids travel around the sun in a loose path that falls between the orbits of the planets Mars and Jupiter.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-largest-object-in-the-asteroid-belt>What is the largest object in the asteroid belt?</h2>
<p>Dwarf planet Ceres<br>
Dwarf planet Ceres is the largest object in the asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter, and it’s the only dwarf planet located in the inner solar system. It was the first member of the asteroid belt to be discovered when Giuseppe Piazzi spotted it in 1801.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-biggest-dwarf-planet>What is the biggest dwarf planet?</h2>
<p>Pluto<br>
The best-known dwarf planet, Pluto is also the largest in size and the second largest in mass. Pluto has five moons.</p>
<h2 id=how-to-create-asteroids-in-the-asteroid-belt>How to create asteroids in the asteroid belt?</h2>
<p>Draw a circle to begin creating your asteroids in the space assigned to the belt. There is a lot of space in the Asteroid Belt, so you don’t want to draw a round wall of rock.</p>
<h2 id=how-to-draw-a-crater-on-an-asteroid>How to draw a crater on an asteroid?</h2>
<p>Draw four or five of these on your circle. Add some smaller circles and lumps to the surface of your circle to show the bumpy surface. Add some shading lines inside some of your crater shapes to give the illusion of depth. Erase your guide lines and color in your asteroid.</p>
<h2 id=what-should-the-color-of-an-asteroid-be>What should the color of an asteroid be?</h2>
<p>Add some smaller circles and lumps to the surface of your circle to show the bumpy surface. Add some shading lines inside some of your crater shapes to give the illusion of depth. Erase your guide lines and color in your asteroid. Generally, asteroids range in color from a dark orange to brown to a dark gray.</p>
<h2 id=how-do-you-draw-the-orbits-of-the-planets>How do you draw the orbits of the planets?</h2>
<p>Outline it and color it yellow. Add in the orbits of the planets, and draw each planet on its orbit, giving each planet its own color. If the Sun is in the center, you’ll have concentric orbits. If the Sun is on one edge, you’ll have the orbits as semicircles (or half ovals).</p>
