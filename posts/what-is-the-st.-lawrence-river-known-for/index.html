<p>Great Lakes system<br>
Lawrence River is one of the longest rivers in North America. And, is the outflow for the entire Great Lakes system. The Great Lakes hold nearly 20% of the world’s fresh water. The River flows 744 miles from Lake Ontario into the world’s largest estuary, the Gulf of St.</p>

<p>The St. Lawrence River served as the main route for European exploration of the North American interior, first pioneered by French explorer Samuel de Champlain. Control of the river was crucial to British strategy to capture New France in the Seven Years’ War.</p>
<h2 id=what-did-the-st-lawrence-river-bring-to-canada>What did the St Lawrence River bring to Canada?</h2>

<p>During the 18th century, early fur traders travelled along the river. During the second half of the 19th century, logging became an important industry in the surrounding Mauricie region.
