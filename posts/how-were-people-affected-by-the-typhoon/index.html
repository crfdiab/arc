<h2 id=how-were-people-affected-by-the-typhoon>How were people affected by the typhoon?</h2>
<p>At least two million people or 400,000 families have been affected, with thousands of homes damaged or destroyed, and at least 10 people killed, according to the latest government figures. The intense storm also caused major damage to crops, with an estimated 20,000 farmers impacted.</p>
<h2 id=why-was-haiyan-so-destructive>Why was Haiyan so destructive?</h2>
<p>With gusts exceeding 305 kilometres (190 miles) per hour at first landfall, Haiyan was the strongest ever to hit land at the time. Typhoons more commonly reach peak velocity while still travelling over oceans. Overall, Haiyan tore across a group of islands with a combined area the size of Portugal.</p>
<h2 id=why-did-the-philippines-suffer-so-badly-during-typhoon-haiyan>Why did the Philippines suffer so badly during Typhoon Haiyan?</h2>
<p>The primary effects of Typhoon Haiyan were caused by physical factors, especially storm surge, high wind speeds and heavy rain. A storm surge from Typhoon Haiyan was particularly severe, especially in the Eastern Visayas. It was as 5 to 6 metres or 16 to 20 feet high on some coasts of Leyte and Samar.</p>
<h2 id=what-were-three-primary-effects-of-typhoon-haiyan>What were three primary effects of Typhoon Haiyan?</h2>
<p>More than 7,000 people were killed by Typhoon Haiyan. 1.9 million people were left homeless and more than 6,000,000 displaced. There were outbreaks of disease due to the lack of sanitation, food, water, shelter, and medication.</p>
<h2 id=what-were-the-main-effects-of-typhoon-haiyan>What were the main effects of Typhoon Haiyan?</h2>
<p>The overall economic impact of Typhoon Haiyan is estimated at $5.8 billion (£3.83 billion). Major rice, corn and sugar-producing areas for the Philippines were destroyed affecting the country’s international trade and farmers’ incomes. Tacloban’s city airport was severely damaged, affecting business and tourism.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-the-long-term-effects-of-typhoon-haiyan>What are the long term effects of Typhoon Haiyan?</h2>

<h2 id=how-many-people-were-affected-by-typhoon-haiyan>How many people were affected by Typhoon Haiyan?</h2>
<p>The typhoon’s fury affected more than 14 million people across 44 provinces, displacing 4.1 million people, killing more than 6,000 people and leaving 1,800 missing. In addition, Typhoon Haiyan damaged 1.1 million houses, destroyed 33 million coconut trees (a major source of livelihoods), and disrupted the livelihoods of 5.9 million workers.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-most-powerful-typhoon-in-history>What was the most powerful typhoon in history?</h2>
<p>It laid waste to the Visayas group of islands, the country’s central region and home to 17 million people. Haiyan was the most powerful storm in 2013 and one of the most powerful typhoons of all time. With wind speeds sustained at more than 150 mph, Haiyan was classified as a super typhoon.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-name-of-the-2013-typhoon-in-the-philippines>What was the name of the 2013 Typhoon in the Philippines?</h2>
<p>This article is about the 2013 typhoon. For other typhoons of the same name, see Typhoon Haiyan (disambiguation). For other uses, see Tropical Storm Yolanda. Typhoon Haiyan, known in the Philippines as Super Typhoon Yolanda, was one of the most powerful tropical cyclones ever recorded.</p>
<h2 id=why-was-the-death-toll-so-high-in-haiyan>Why was the death toll so high in Haiyan?</h2>
<p>Several factors caused the staggering death toll: With gusts exceeding 305 kilometres (190 miles) per hour at first landfall, Haiyan was the strongest ever to hit land at the time. Typhoons more commonly reach peak velocity while still travelling over oceans.</p>
