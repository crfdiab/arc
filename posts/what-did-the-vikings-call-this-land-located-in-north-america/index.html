<h2 id=what-did-the-vikings-call-this-land-located-in-north-america>What did the Vikings call this land located in North America?</h2>
<p>Viking: The western seas, Vinland, and Ireland North America, which they called Vinland (land of wild grapes).</p>
<h2 id=what-did-the-vikings-name-where-they-landed>What did the Vikings name where they landed?</h2>
<p>Calling their landing place Vinland (Wine-land), they built a temporary settlement at L’Anse aux Meadows in modern-day Newfoundland. Beyond that, there is little evidence of Viking presence in the New World, and they didn’t form permanent settlements.</p>
<h2 id=where-in-america-did-the-vikings-land>Where in America did the Vikings land?</h2>
<p>The Norse colonization of North America began in the late 10th century, when Norsemen explored and settled areas of the North Atlantic including the northeastern fringes of North America. Remains of Norse buildings were found at L’Anse aux Meadows near the northern tip of Newfoundland in 1960.</p>
<h2 id=what-viking-sailor-landed-in-north-america>What Viking sailor landed in North America?</h2>
<p>Leif Erikson<br>
Leif Erikson, Leiv Eiriksson or Leif Ericson ( c. 970 – c. 1020) was a Norse explorer from Iceland. He is thought to have been the first European to have set foot on continental North America (excluding Greenland), approximately half a millennium before Christopher Columbus.</p>
<h2 id=where-was-vinland-in-north-america-did-the-vikings>Where was Vinland in North America did the Vikings?</h2>
<p>Vinland is Newfoundland. It is not some little island; it is not all of America (Leif Eriksson had already named two other parts: Markland and Helluland). Nor is it New England.</p>
<h2 id=where-did-the-vikings-end-up-in-the-new-world>Where did the Vikings end up in the New World?</h2>
<p>In seeking to answer the question of where exactly in North America our titular Vikings ended up, it’s necessary to look at the evidence of where in the New World their real-world historical counterparts tried – and ultimately failed – to gain a foothold.</p>
<h2 id=where-does-the-story-of-the-vikings-come-from>Where does the story of the Vikings come from?</h2>
<p>The bulk of what we know about that place and time comes from the Icelandic and Greenland Sagas, and the Saga of Erik the Red, all of which were written at least two centuries after the events they describe. Furthermore, all of them contain, swimming among the truth, embellishments, flights of fancy and flat-out fake news.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-erik-eriksson-lead-the-vikings-to-north-america>How did Erik Eriksson lead the Vikings to North America?</h2>
<p>Erik’s peripatetic ambitions rested there, but were passed on to his sons, especially Leif Eriksson, whose adventurous spirit would lead the Vikings to North America. Again… by accident. But not Leif’s accident.</p>
