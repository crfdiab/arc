<h2 id=what-is-the-characteristics-of-mission-and-vision>What is the characteristics of mission and vision?</h2>
<p>Often a mission is viewed as a summary of your organization. The mission is a proclamation of our organization’s purpose. It usually does not change too much over time. A mission represents something to be accomplished whereas a vision is something to be pursued.</p>

<p>Nike’s mission statement might sound run-of-the-mill, but it effectively sums up what they aim to do and how they aim to do it. Take note of the words that declare Nike’s underlying company values: Innovation, sustainability, diversity, and community. However, it’s Nike’s vision statement that has captured the hearts of millions.</p>
<h2 id=why-do-companies-need-a-mission-and-vision-statement>Why do companies need a mission and vision statement?</h2>
<p>To become a runaway success, businesses must have a purpose that unites and inspires people – “make more money” won’t do the trick. As the author Simon Sinek said, “People don’t buy what you do, they buy why you do it.” This is why organizations create mission and vision statements.</p>
