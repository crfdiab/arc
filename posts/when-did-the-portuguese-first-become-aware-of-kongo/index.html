<p>1483<br>
When Portuguese arrived in Kongo in 1483, Nzinga a Nkuwu was the manikongo.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-main-objective-of-the-portuguese-expeditions-that-arrived-in-the-kongo-kingdom-in-the-late-fifteenth-century>What was the main objective of the Portuguese expeditions that arrived in the Kongo kingdom in the late fifteenth century?</h2>
<p>Motivated by the desire for new markets and an ongoing opposition to the Muslims, Portuguese sailors had begun to explore the West African coast in the first half of the fifteenth century.</p>
<h2 id=why-the-portuguese-were-the-first-to-come-to-africa>Why the Portuguese were the first to come to Africa?</h2>
<p>Portuguese expansion into Africa began with the desire of King John I to gain access to the gold-producing areas of West Africa. The trans-Saharan trade routes between Songhay and the North African traders provided Europe with gold coins used to trade spices, silks and other luxuries from India.</p>
<h2 id=what-did-the-kongo-want-from-portugal>What did the Kongo want from Portugal?</h2>
<p>Slave Trading Initially, the Kongo were glad to trade with the Portuguese, because the relationship provided a new market for their goods and they received goods from the Portuguese. The Kongo also hoped that the Portuguese would share new technological knowledge.</p>
<h2 id=what-did-the-portuguese-want-from-the-kongo>What did the Portuguese want from the Kongo?</h2>
<h2 id=why-did-the-portuguese-go-to-war-with-kongo>Why did the Portuguese go to war with Kongo?</h2>
<p>The Portuguese teamed with the Kingdom of Kongo and were able to repel them. By the early 17th century, that mostly peaceful existence was fraying. As with other European forces throughout the colonial expansion and claiming Africa period, Portugal wanted to expand. Not only that, but the country wanted rich land–Kongo land.</p>
<h2 id=when-did-the-portuguese-first-arrive-in-indonesia>When did the Portuguese first arrive in Indonesia?</h2>
<p>Portuguese Colonization. The Portuguese arrived in Indonesia in 1511 looking for natural resources and to promote Christianity. The Portuguese entered Indonesia in 1511 searching for spices and to spread the ideas of Christianity.</p>
<h2 id=when-did-portugal-start-trading-with-west-africa>When did Portugal start trading with West Africa?</h2>
<p>It was this search that led the Portuguese down the coast of West Africa to Sierra Leone in 1460. Due to several technological and cultural advantages, Portugal dominated world trade for nearly 200 years, from the fifteenth to the sixteenth century.</p>
<h2 id=why-did-the-portuguese-come-to-the-east-indies>Why did the Portuguese come to the East Indies?</h2>
<p>Starting with the first exploratory expeditions sent from newly conquered Malacca in 1512, the Portuguese were the first Europeans to arrive in the East Indies, and sought to dominate the sources of valuable spices and to extend their Roman Catholic missionary efforts.</p>
