<h2 id=why-would-an-astronaut-weigh-less-on-the-moon-than-on-earth>Why would an astronaut weigh less on the moon than on Earth?</h2>
<p>Objects on the Moon weigh less than they do on the Earth because the gravitational field strength is much less. On the Moon, astronauts can jump higher and leap farther than on Earth.</p>
<h2 id=are-you-completely-weightless-on-the-moon>Are you completely weightless on the Moon?</h2>
<p>Since the Moon is smaller than Earth, it has a weaker gravitational pull. In fact, the Moon only has 1/6 the gravity that Earth does. This means you weigh six times less on the Moon than you do on Earth!</p>
<h2 id=how-heavy-am-i-on-the-moon>How heavy Am I on the moon?</h2>
<p>Your weight on the Moon is 16.5% what you would experience on Earth. In other words, if you weighed 100 kg on Earth, you would weigh a mere 16.5 kg on the Moon. For you imperial folks, imagine you tipped the scales at 200 pounds. Your weight on the Moon would only be 33 pounds.</p>
<h2 id=how-much-does-an-astronaut-weigh-on-the-moon>How much does an astronaut weigh on the Moon?</h2>
<p>So,weight on moon is 1/6 times to weight on earth. So,astronaut weigh less on moon than earth.</p>
<h2 id=why-is-our-weight-on-the-moon-less-than-on-earth>Why is our weight on the Moon less than on Earth?</h2>
<p>Our weight on moon is less than it would be on Earth due to a difference of the strength of gravity on the moon. The moon’s gravitation force is determined by the mass and the size of the moon.</p>
<h2 id=why-are-astronauts-weightless-in-space-but-have-mass>Why are astronauts weightless in space but have mass?</h2>
<p>Your weight provides the centripetal force that makes you travel in a circular (or elliptical) path. ACTUALLY YOU ARE WEIGHTLESS. YOU STILL HAVE MASS THOUGH. MASS PROVIDES NO FORCES EITHER. THE FORCE OF GRAVITY BETWEEN THE MASS OF THE EARTH AND YOUR BODY, AS WELL AS THE FORCE PROVIDED BY THE SHUTTLE PROVIDES THE FORCE.</p>
<h2 id=why-is-gravity-lighter-on-the-moon-than-on-mars>Why is gravity lighter on the Moon than on Mars?</h2>
<p>On the other hand, if you do fall over, your low weight will make it easier to get up. So, why is gravity lighter on the moon and Mars? Because the mass is less. Mars is less than half the diameter of Earth, and the moon is even smaller. There is just less matter there exerting a gravitational pull on you. On Jupiter, the opposite is true.</p>
