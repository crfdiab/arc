<p>Rainy Season in Africa Many countries in Africa experience two rainy seasons: a major rainy season which takes place roughly from April through June, and a shorter rainy season from October through December. The rainy period of April through June is wet and humid, making coastal areas unpleasant.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-season-in-africa>What is the season in Africa?</h2>
<p>Seasons in Africa are opposite of North American seasons, so its autumn runs from March through May; spring runs from September through November.

<h2 id=whats-the-difference-between-dry-and-rainy-seasons-in-africa>What’s the difference between dry and rainy seasons in Africa?</h2>
<p>Safari destinations in Africa are vastly different during rainy seasons versus dry seasons. Let’s talk about how they’re different.
