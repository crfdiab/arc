<h2 id=why-does-new-york-get-colder-than-london>Why does New York get colder than London?</h2>
<p>In the winter London is warmed by prevailing winds from the South West, warmed by warm water carried from the Caribbean by the Gulf Stream, whilst New York has a more continental winter. So London is usually warmer in winter than New York, and much much warmer in winter than almost anywhere else that is as far north.</p>
<h2 id=is-new-york-colder-than-london-in-winter>Is New York colder than London in winter?</h2>
<p>New York City’s average lows during the winter months are mostly in the 20s and 30s Fahrenheit, whereas London’s winter lows hover around 40 degrees F. NYC’s summer highs are around 80 degrees F, and London’s are a good 10 degrees cooler, around 70 degrees F.</p>
<h2 id=is-it-colder-in-new-york-or-england>Is it colder in New York or England?</h2>
<p>Based on your climate statistics, New York is only 5 degrees (F) colder than London in winter. It’s certainly warmer in summer, though.</p>
<h2 id=why-is-new-york-so-cold-in-winter>Why is New York so cold in winter?</h2>
<p>NYC will often come under the influence of large arctic high pressure systems in the winter that descend down from Canada and tend to funnel cold arctic air down from Canada and hold it in place over the northeastern U.S.</p>
<h2 id=which-is-the-coldest-part-of-the-uk-in-the-winter>Which is the coldest part of the UK in the winter?</h2>
<p>This is because the huge mass of water holds heat better than land and so ‘heats’ Wales and Western England during the winter. Scotland is the coldest part of the UK throughout the year, and has average minimum temperatures of just -0.2 o C during the winter.</p>
<h2 id=whats-the-weather-like-in-london-in-the-winter>What’s the weather like in London in the winter?</h2>
<p>London almost creates its own weather conditions due to its sheer size. The urban landscape means that temperatures are often a couple of degrees higher than in surrounding areas, meaning snow is less common in the winter. Generally, the further North in England you go, the colder the average temperatures get and the windier it gets.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-lowest-temperature-in-new-york-city>What was the lowest temperature in New York City?</h2>
<p>The lowest temperature recorded there during that period was -15 degrees Fahrenheit (-26 Celsius) on February 9, 1934. Jay Lawrimore. 2016. Global Summary of the Year, Version 1.0. NOAA National Centers for Environmental Information.</p>
<h2 id=why-does-the-uk-have-milder-winters-than-other-countries>Why does the UK have milder winters than other countries?</h2>
<p>The fact that the West of the UK is so close to the Atlantic Ocean means that it has milder winters. This is because the huge mass of water holds heat better than land and so ‘heats’ Wales and Western England during the winter.</p>
