<h2 id=how-has-the-environment-changed-in-new-york>How has the environment changed in New York?</h2>
<p>New York’s climate is changing. Most of the state has warmed one to three degrees (F) in the last century, heavy rainstorms are more frequent, and the sea is rising about one inch every decade. Higher water levels are eroding beaches, submerging low lands, and exacerbating coastal flooding.</p>
<h2 id=what-contributes-to-climate-change-in-new-york>What contributes to climate change in New York?</h2>
<p>NYC’s GHG emissions come almost entirely from the combustion of fossil fuels to provide energy. However, this energy is delivered in many different forms. Carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions from fossil fuel combustion and industrialization is the primary cause of climate change.</p>
<h2 id=how-has-climate-change-affected-new-york-city>How has climate change affected New York City?</h2>
<p>Climate change is estimated to cause the sea level along the coast of New York City to rise anywhere from one to three and a half feet by 2080 at a cost of billions of dollars in lost property and assets. Storm surges affecting shoreline properties will also increase by as much as 15 feet in that same timeframe.</p>
<h2 id=how-do-people-depend-on-the-environment-in-new-york-city>How do people depend on the environment in New York City?</h2>
<p>Residents of New York adapt to the environment by using air conditioning and heating. They depend on the Hudson River for transportation. In New York City, many people run, walk, or bike through Central Park. Citizens in the rural areas of New York farm and grow crops.</p>
<h2 id=how-has-new-york-city-changed-over-the-years>How has New York City changed over the years?</h2>
<p>How has NYC changed over the years? Some things in New York City have been a constant for decades, such as the heavy traffic, Wall Street or the fact that the Big Apple is the most populous city in the country. Of course, cities are always changing, and a city as large as New York City has changed quite a bit over the past 100 years.</p>
<h2 id=how-are-people-adapting-to-the-environment-in-new-york>How are people adapting to the environment in New York?</h2>
<p>Air pollution from factories and automobiles is a prominent issue. Residents of New York adapt to the environment by using air conditioning and heating. They depend on the Hudson River for transportation. In New York City, many people run, walk, or bike through Central Park. Citizens in the rural areas of New York farm and grow crops.</p>
<h2 id=how-many-people-live-in-new-york-city>How many people live in New York City?</h2>
<p>Ten mega cities now have populations over 12 million, with Tokyo the largest (26 million) and the New York City Metropolitan Area 6th largest (17 million). Between 1990 and 2025, the number of people living in urban areas is projected to double to more than 5 billion with 90 percent of that increase to occur in developing countries.</p>
<h2 id=how-is-new-york-a-model-for-urbanization>How is New York a model for urbanization?</h2>
<p>New York as a Model for the Study of Urbanization At the beginning of the twenty-first century, for the first time in human history, more of the world’s population lives in cities than in rural areas. Increasing numbers of people live in huge mega-cities where human activities dominate the landscape and every local ecosystem.</p>
