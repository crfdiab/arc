<p>At 9:57 pm on D-Day, June 6, 1944, FDR sat in front of a microphone in the Diplomatic Reception Room at the White House waiting to begin a national radio address. Earlier in the day the President had held a press conference in the Oval Office for over 180 reporters.</p>

<p>General Dwight D. Eisenhower<br>
On June 6, 1944, Supreme Allied Commander General Dwight D. Eisenhower gives the go-ahead for the largest amphibious military operation in history: Operation Overlord, the Allied invasion of northern France, commonly known as D-Day. By daybreak, 18,000 British and American parachutists were already on the ground.</p>
<h2 id=who-planned-d-day>Who planned D-Day?</h2>
<p>Other prominent military leaders involved in the planning of Operation Overlord were Omar Nelson Bradley, Miles Dempsey, and even George Patton. Bradley was appointed to command the 1st U.S. Army in the invasion, and Montgomery selected Dempsey to command the mixed British and Canadian 2nd Army.</p>
<h2 id=who-was-the-american-general-on-d-day>Who was the American general on D Day?</h2>
<p>D-DAY GENERALS: DWIGHT D. EISENHOWER. Anglo-American fortunes under Eisenhower were almost uniformly successful, excepting the ill-fated airborne assault into Holland in September and the surprise German offensive in the Ardennes in December. At year’s end Eisenhower was promoted to General of the Army.</p>
<h2 id=who-was-responsible-for-the-success-of-d-day>Who was responsible for the success of D Day?</h2>
<p>A number of American and British D-day generals were responsible for its success, including Dwight Eisenhower, Trafford Leigh-Mallory, and many others</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-original-date-for-d-day>What was the original date for D Day?</h2>
<p>The original date for D-Day was 5 June 1944 (see the D-Day timeline ), but unseasonably rough weather forced a reconsideration. Eisenhower accepted the optimistic assessment of Group Captain J. M. Stagg, the chief meteorologist, who called for about thirty-six hours of decent weather over the sixth.</p>
<h2 id=who-was-the-general-of-the-army-in-1944>Who was the General of the Army in 1944?</h2>
<p>At year’s end Eisenhower was promoted to General of the Army. He was Time magazine’s Man of the Year for 1944 and again received the accolade as president in 1959. Despite his demonstrated success, Eisenhower’s overall strategy has been criticized.</p>
