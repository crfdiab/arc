<h2 id=does-india-have-a-trash-problem>Does India have a trash problem?</h2>
<p>Trash mountain In India, about 70% of the plastic the country consumes is simply discarded. Large amounts end up in the water by way of the River Ganges, which comes second only to China’s Yangtze in the amount of plastic it contributed to the world’s oceans, according to a 2017 study.</p>
<h2 id=does-india-have-the-most-trash>Does India have the most trash?</h2>
<p>The World Bank study revealed that India was the world’s highest waste-generating nation. “Of the total collected waste, only 20 per cent (27,000 MT per day) is processed and the remaining 80 per cent (1,08,000 MT per day) is dumped in landfill sites,” the news report noted.</p>
<h2 id=what-does-india-do-with-garbage>What does India do with garbage?</h2>
<p>India is getting buried in its own garbage as a huge quantity of solid waste generated daily is never picked up and poisons land, air and water. Of the total collected waste, only 20% (27,000 MT per day) is processed and the rest is dumped at landfill sites.</p>
<h2 id=where-does-india-dump-their-garbage>Where does India dump their garbage?</h2>
<p>India’s national capital has three waste dumping sites – Bhalswa, Ghazipur and Okhla – and among them, the Ghazipur dump is already in running to be taller in height than national monuments like Qutub Minar and Taj Mahal.</p>
<h2 id=where-does-indias-waste-go>Where does India’s waste go?</h2>
<p>But in many cities of India, the waste that is generated is just recklessly dumped in most cases, some is dumped on the streets and some is dumped in landfills that are not properly managed and this ends up polluting the air, soil, and underground water.</p>
<h2 id=how-big-is-the-trash-can-in-india>How big is the trash can in India?</h2>
<p>At the start of the millennium, the picturesque Spanish city of Barcelona decided to ‘go green’ and free its historic land of waste. And so, 103.7 metric tonnes of Barcelona’s garbage — from shredded plastic carry bags to used diapers and napkins — arrived last August at the nondescript port of Tuticorin in southern India.</p>
<h2 id=why-does-india-want-to-burn-its-trash>Why does India want to burn its trash?</h2>
<p>India is planning to burn more of its trash to generate badly needed electricity. But as the case of a waste-to-energy plant in New Delhi shows, critics are worried about lax air pollution controls and the impact of incineration on people who eke out a living picking through waste dumps.</p>
<h2 id=which-is-the-best-way-to-dispose-of-waste-in-india>Which is the best way to dispose of waste in India?</h2>
<p>“Many municipalities simply dump the waste and claim these dumps are landfills. Landfilling should be done only for inorganic wastes and the rejects after processing. The landfilled waste should be compacted and put under soil cover daily so that there is no fear of pollution,” says the CPCB official.</p>
<h2 id=where-does-the-trash-in-delhi-come-from>Where does the trash in Delhi come from?</h2>
<p>The trash no longer comes directly from the streets of Delhi but via the Timarpur Okhla Waste Management Plant. Since late 2011, the plant has been accepting 1,950 metric tons of trash each day, a quarter of Delhi’s total, and burning it to convert its embedded energy into electricity. The ash is what’s left over.</p>
