<h2 id=how-did-horace-pippin-cope-with-the-war>How did Horace Pippin cope with the war?</h2>
<p>Now married and doing some odd jobs for a few pennies, Horace found for himself a way to deal with the horrendous memories of the war and the frustrating present situation: he began to draw again. First on discarded cigar boxes or by burning images onto wood panels using a hot poker.</p>
<h2 id=where-was-horace-pippin-in-mrprejudice>Where was Horace Pippin in mr.prejudice?</h2>
<p>Horace Pippin, Mr. Prejudice, 1943, Philadelphia Museum of Art, PA, USA. Horace was assigned to the 369th Infantry Regiment, a division of African American soldiers. This division was later joined to the French Army, since many white American soldiers refused to march with black men.</p>
<h2 id=why-did-horace-pippin-take-so-long-to-paint>Why did Horace Pippin take so long to paint?</h2>
<p>It took Horace Pippin forty – three years to complete his first oil painting. Why so long? Because poverty, hard physical work, war, and disabilities got in his way. Yet, all the negative experiences didn’t diminish his passion for drawing and at the age of fifty this passion eventually paid off.</p>
