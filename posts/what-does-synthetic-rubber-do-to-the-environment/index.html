<h2 id=what-does-synthetic-rubber-do-to-the-environment>What does synthetic rubber do to the environment?</h2>
<p>As it decomposes, the chemicals in the rubber leach into the soil and nearby water sources. Many of these chemicals, as well as heavy metals, are dangerous to plants, soil and aquatic systems.</p>
<h2 id=is-synthetic-rubber-better-for-the-environment>Is synthetic rubber better for the environment?</h2>
<p>Natural rubber or tree-derived rubber is eco-friendly. Harvesting and using the product itself has less impact on the environment. So much of our rubber products are produced by chemical (synthetic) means. Not so good for the environment.</p>
<h2 id=why-is-synthetic-rubber-important-to-society>Why is synthetic rubber important to society?</h2>
<p>A synthetic rubber is any artificial elastomer. Synthetic rubbers are superior to natural rubbers in two major respects, thermal stability and resistance to oils and related compounds. They are more resistant to oxidizing agents for example, such as oxygen and ozone which can reduce the life of products like tires.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-positive-impacts-of-synthetic-rubber>What are positive impacts of synthetic rubber?</h2>
<p>Compared to natural rubber, the advantages of synthetic rubber include its excellent abrasion resistance and ability to adhere to metals, making it a great option for rubber gaskets, seals and other products. Synthetic rubber also excels in extreme temperatures due to good heat resistance and heat-aging qualities.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-the-negative-effects-of-synthetic-rubber>What are the negative effects of synthetic rubber?</h2>
<p>NEGATIVE EFFECTS ON THE ENVIRONMENT Soot is one of the worst effects of synthetic rubber. During the vulcinization of synthetic rubber, soot is produced. Soot is a carbon particle that contributes to climate change. Soot being released into the atmosphere.</p>
<h2 id=does-rubber-pollute>Does rubber pollute?</h2>
<p>Synthetic and natural rubber dust and fragments now occur in food, airborne as particulates in air pollution, hidden in the earth as soil pollution, and in waterways, lakes and the sea. …</p>
<h2 id=what-are-the-pros-and-cons-of-synthetic-rubber>What are the pros and cons of synthetic rubber?</h2>
<p>Generally, synthetic rubber is better than natural rubber in terms of temperature resistance, ageing resistance and resistance to abrasion. Synthetic rubber also tends to be cheaper to produce.</p>
<h2 id=is-synthetic-rubber-poisonous>Is synthetic rubber poisonous?</h2>
<p>The manufacture of synthetic rubber involves several chemical compounds which are toxic to man. A summary of the health hazards involved in the manufacturing process is warranted, as great quantities of synthetic material are being made.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-the-disadvantages-of-rubber>What are the disadvantages of rubber?</h2>
<p>DISADVANTAGES: NATURAL RUBBER does not perform well when exposed to chemicals and petroleum derivatives, including petrochemicals. It is not recommended for outdoor applications where maximum resistance to sunlight, ozone, oxygen or heat aging is major factors.</p>
<h2 id=where-are-natural-and-synthetic-rubber-products-produced>Where are natural and synthetic rubber products produced?</h2>
<p>The rubber-producing sector is divided into two types of products: natural rubber and synthetic rubber. Natural rubber is an agricultural good primarily produced in East Asia and accounts for approximately 25 percent of rubber used in industrial production.</p>
<h2 id=what-kind-of-rubber-is-used-in-the-rubber-industry>What kind of rubber is used in the rubber industry?</h2>
<p>There are two basic types of rubber used in the rubber industry: natural and synthetic. A number of different synthetic rubber polymers are used to make a wide variety of rubber products (see table 1).</p>
<h2 id=how-big-was-the-synthetic-rubber-industry-in-1906>How big was the synthetic rubber industry in 1906?</h2>
<p>In 1906, worldwide natural rubber output was 60,000 tonnes, already an inadequate amount for the rising demand created by the burgeoning automobile industry, according to the 1990 book: Synthetic Rubber – The Story of An Industry, published by the International Institute of Synthetic Rubber Producers (IISRP).</p>
<h2 id=what-are-the-main-problems-of-synthetic-rubber>What are the main problems of synthetic rubber?</h2>
<p>For synthetic rubbers, analysis problems boil down to two determinations: identification of the constitutive groups and determination of spatial arrangement.</p>
