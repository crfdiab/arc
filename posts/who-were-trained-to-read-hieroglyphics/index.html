<p>scribes<br>
Since writing in hieroglyphics was so complicated, it took years of education and practice to be able to do it. The people who trained to write were called scribes. They would start training at a very young age of six or seven. Being a scribe was a good job in Ancient Egypt.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-they-write-in-ancient-egypt>How did they write in ancient Egypt?</h2>
<p>The ancient Egyptians used the distinctive script known today as hieroglyphs (Greek for “sacred words”) for almost 4,000 years. Hieroglyphs were written on papyrus, carved in stone on tomb and temple walls, and used to decorate many objects of cultic and daily life use.</p>
<h2 id=who-were-the-writers-of-ancient-egypt>Who were the writers of ancient Egypt?</h2>
<p>Notable writers</p>
<ul>
<li>Taha Husayn.</li>
<li>Yūsuf Idrīs.</li>
<li>Sonallah Ibrahim.</li>
<li>Tawfiq al-Hakim.</li>
<li>Gamal Abdel Nasser.</li>
<li>Naguib Mahfouz.</li>
<li>Nawal El Saadawi.</li>
<li>Bahaa Taher.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id=who-was-educated-in-ancient-egypt>Who was educated in ancient Egypt?</h2>
<p>Egyptian School. Formal education in ancient Egypt was mostly reserved for the boys of wealthier families. Although there is some evidence that occasionally, girls did go to school and even became doctors. Boys usually started school at the age of 7 and they were taught to read and write as well as mathematics.</p>
<h2 id=what-kind-of-writing-did-the-ancient-egyptians-use>What kind of writing did the ancient Egyptians use?</h2>
<p>By the Late Period of Egyptian History, just before Alexander the Great came and left his Hellenistic influence and the Ptolemies to reign over the land of Kemet, the scribes of Egypt used three distinct scripts in their writing: hieroglyphic, hieratic, and demotic.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-job-of-a-scribe-in-ancient-egypt>What was the job of a scribe in ancient Egypt?</h2>
<p>Being a scribe was a good job in Ancient Egypt. Scribes didn’t have to pay taxes or enter the army. They were very highly thought of and only the children of the wealthy got the opportunity to train as scribes. The Ancient Egyptians often wrote on tablets or walls, but they also wrote on a type of paper called papyrus.</p>
<h2 id=what-kind-of-education-did-the-ancient-egyptians-have>What kind of Education did the ancient Egyptians have?</h2>
<p>Slothfulness and disrespect earned harsh punishments. When young boys reached 7 years of age, they began their formal education, which consisted of subjects similar to those taught today: reading, writing, sports, math, and social graces.</p>
<h2 id=can-a-girl-be-a-scribe-in-ancient-egypt>Can a girl be a scribe in ancient Egypt?</h2>
<p>Girls were not usually permitted to become scribes, although there were exceptions. History documents a few female doctors in ancient Egypt and those women were also trained as scribes so that they could understand medical texts as well as document the treatments rendered.</p>
