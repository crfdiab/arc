<h2 id=why-moon-is-spherical-in-shape>Why moon is spherical in shape?</h2>
<p>A body as massive as a planet or large moon has sufficient gravity to pull its solid rock, liquid oceans, and gaseous atmosphere into the shape of a sphere. Smaller bodies like asteroids lack the mass—and thus the gravity—to pull their rocky surfaces into a spherical shape.</p>
<h2 id=why-are-planets-and-moons-spherical>Why are planets and moons spherical?</h2>
<p>All of the planets are round because of gravity. When our Solar System was forming, gravity gathered billions of pieces of gas and dust into clumps which grew larger and larger to become the planets. The force of the collision of these pieces caused the newly forming planets to become hot and molten.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-the-moon-form-into-a-sphere>How did the moon form into a sphere?</h2>
<p>Theia, an early protoplanet the size of Mars, hit Earth in such a way that it ejected a considerable amount of material away from Earth. Some proportion of these ejecta escaped into space, but the rest consolidated into a single spherical body in orbit about Earth, creating the Moon.</p>
<h2 id=are-all-moons-are-spherical>Are all moons are spherical?</h2>
<p>Have you noticed that a good portion of things in space are shaped like a sphere? Stars, planets, and moons are all spherical.</p>
<h2 id=why-are-bodies-in-space-spherical>Why are bodies in space spherical?</h2>
<p>It uses its gravity to snag bits of space stuff. A planet’s gravity pulls equally from all sides. Gravity pulls from the center to the edges like the spokes of a bicycle wheel. This makes the overall shape of a planet a sphere, which is a three-dimensional circle.</p>
<h2 id=why-is-the-earths-moon-a-spherical-object>Why is the Earth’s Moon a spherical object?</h2>
<p>Gravity is a force that points inwards from all directions towards a centre. Small asteroids and moons can be non-spherical, but after they reach about 600 km in diameter, the force of their gravity can “break” the rock from which they are made. All the bumps are pulled down, and they become more spherical.</p>

<p>The Sun, the Earth, the Moon and the other planets and their moons… all spheres. Except for the stuff which isn’t spheres. What’s going on? Have you noticed that a good portion of things in space are shaped like a sphere? Stars, planets, and moons are all spherical. Why? It all comes down to gravity.</p>
<h2 id=why-is-the-earths-moon-different-from-the-other-moons>Why is the Earth’s Moon different from the other moons?</h2>
<p>Unlike the other big moons like Ganymede, Titan, Europa, Callisto and Triton, our Moon lacks any real atmosphere and isn’t covered in ice. Sure, it is a lot closer to the Sun, so maybe it lost much of its ice (there is some), but it is a much more desolate locale compared to the icy moons of the solar system.</p>
