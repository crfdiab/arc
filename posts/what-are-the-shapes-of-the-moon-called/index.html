<h2 id=what-are-the-shapes-of-the-moon-called>What are the shapes of the Moon called?</h2>
<p>These are the banana-shaped crescent Moon, the D-shaped quarter Moon and the almost complete gibbous Moon. Finally, each phase is also named after its position in the full 29.5 day cycle based on whether it is growing (waxing) or shrinking (waning). The eight phases of the Moon in order are: new Moon.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-the-8-shapes-of-the-moon>What are the 8 shapes of the Moon?</h2>
<p>Full moon, new moon, half-moon, quarter moon, waning moon and crescent moons are the phases of the moon. The sun always lights up half of the moon. Then, the other half of it is in complete darkness. The moonlight we see is just reflected sunlight.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-it-called-when-the-lighted-portion-of-the-moon>What is it called when the lighted portion of the Moon?</h2>
<p>Waxing Gibbous phase occurs when the Moon is mostly lit and the illuminated portion is egg-shaped (gibbous) with the eastern edge shaded.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-shape-of-the-illuminated-portion-of-the-moon>What is the shape of the illuminated portion of the Moon?</h2>
<p>The lunar phase or phase of the moon is the shape of the illuminated (sunlit) portion of the Moon as seen by an observer on Earth.</p>
<h2 id=when-was-the-first-time-a-human-stepped-on-the-moon>When was the first time a human stepped on the moon?</h2>
<p>July 20, 1969<br>
Commander Neil Armstrong and lunar module pilot Buzz Aldrin formed the American crew that landed the Apollo Lunar Module Eagle on July 20, 1969, at 20:17 UTC. Armstrong became the first person to step onto the lunar surface six hours and 39 minutes later on July 21 at 02:56 UTC; Aldrin joined him 19 minutes later.</p>
<h2 id=why-do-they-call-it-a-gibbous-moon>Why do they call it a gibbous moon?</h2>
<p>You’ll see a waxing gibbous moon between a first quarter moon and full moon. The word gibbous comes from a root word that means hump-backed. It’s easy to see a waxing gibbous moon in the daytime because, at this phase of the moon, a respectably large fraction of the moon’s dayside faces our way.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-half-moon-called>What is Half moon called?</h2>
<p>Quarter Moon<br>
With the Quarter Moon—which looks like half the Moon—we can see exactly 50% of the Moon’s face illuminated from Earth. Sometimes it also gets confusing to remember which “Quarter” we are seeing: The Moon appears lit on the right half of the Moon during the First Quarter.</p>
<h2 id=what-do-the-phases-of-the-moon-look-like>What do the phases of the Moon look like?</h2>
<p>Each of these phases occur at slightly different times when viewed from different points on Earth. During the intervals between principal phases, the Moon’s apparent shape is either crescent or gibbous.</p>
<h2 id=what-does-the-far-side-of-the-moon-look-like>What does the far side of the Moon look like?</h2>
<p>At that point, the far side of the Moon is facing the Sun. This phase is called a new moon. During the new moon, the side facing Earth is dark. ? New: We cannot see the Moon when it is a new moon. ? Waxing Crescent: In the Northern Hemisphere, we see the waxing crescent phase as a thin crescent of light on the right.</p>
<h2 id=why-does-the-moon-have-the-same-shape-every-month>Why does the Moon have the same shape every month?</h2>
<p>The Moon’s shape changes for the following reasons: The Moon orbits Earth. Both Earth and the Moon orbit the Sun. The Moon’s orbit is the same length as the time it spins on its axis (about 28 Earth days), which means that we see the same part of the lunar surface all month.</p>
<h2 id=why-does-the-moon-look-full-when-the-sun-is-on-opposite-side-of-the-earth>Why does the Moon look full when the Sun is on opposite side of the Earth?</h2>
<p>Full moons occur when the sun and moon are on opposite sides of Earth. Technically the moon is only 100% illuminated by the sun for a few moments, but this phase also covers when the moon looks full but isn’t.</p>
