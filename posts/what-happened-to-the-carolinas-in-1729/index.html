<h2 id=what-happened-to-the-carolinas-in-1729>What happened to the Carolinas in 1729?</h2>
<p>On July 25, 1729, North Carolina became a royal colony when the Lords Proprietors sold the colony to King George II. South Carolina had become a royal colony 10 years earlier, setting the stage for North Carolina to follow suit. During the next 40 years the colony grew rapidly.</p>
<h2 id=what-happened-to-the-carolinas-in-1712>What happened to the Carolinas in 1712?</h2>
<p>In 1712, the two provinces became separate colonies, the colony of North Carolina (formerly Albemarle province) and the colony of South Carolina (formerly Clarendon province).</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-carolinas-colony-known-for>What was the Carolinas colony known for?</h2>
<p>South Carolina became one of the wealthiest early colonies largely due to exports of cotton, rice, tobacco, and indigo dye. Much of the colony’s economy was dependent upon the stolen labor of enslaved people that supported large land operations similar to plantations.</p>
<h2 id=what-did-people-do-in-colonial-north-carolina>What did people do in colonial North Carolina?</h2>
<p>Colonial North Carolina’s warm, humid climate was perfect for growing tobacco and rice, so most early settlers worked on tobacco and rice plantations, according to the North Carolina Business History website HistoryNC.org.</p>
<h2 id=why-did-people-come-to-the-carolinas>Why did people come to the Carolinas?</h2>
<p>The harbor and natural coastline of southern Carolina allowed easier trade with the West Indies. The result was the development of an urban, cultured, and cosmopolitan society made up of wealthy planters and merchants. In the north, many settlers were small farmers who drifted down from Virginia and planted tobacco, as they had done at home.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-life-like-in-the-south-carolina-colony>What was life like in the South Carolina colony?</h2>
<p>The colony in South Carolina had a good harbor and was closely linked more in trade with Barbados and other islands in the Caribbean. The climate in South Carolina was mild. The settlers began raising cattle, engaged in the fur trade and sold supplies to passing ships. In 1680 the colony was relocated as Charleston.</p>

<p>Three major language families were represented in the American Indian population: Iroquoian, Siouan, and Algonquian. Early inhabitants included the Cherokee, Catawba, Creek, and Tuscarora, among many others.</p>
