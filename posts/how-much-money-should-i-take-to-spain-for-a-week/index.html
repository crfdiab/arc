<h2 id=how-much-money-should-i-take-to-spain-for-a-week>How much money should I take to Spain for a week?</h2>
<p>How much money to take to Spain varies enormously on what you plan to do, but you should bank on about £30-£40 per person per day (£200-£250 per week) of spending money to cover meals, trips out and all the many attractions Spain has to offer.</p>
<h2 id=is-spain-affordable-to-visit>Is Spain affordable to visit?</h2>
<p>The Spaniards love visitors, hosting strangers, drinking good wine, laughing at a good meal, and enjoying life. People aren’t in a rush here. And, as an added bonus, Spain is super cheap. It’s a very inexpensive country to visit.</p>
<h2 id=is-spain-cheap-or-expensive>Is Spain cheap or expensive?</h2>
<p>Spain, in general, is not an expensive country to live in. According to OECD data, the income per capita in Spain is 10.000 USD lower than the average OECD level (around € 20.000).</p>
<h2 id=can-i-use-us-money-in-spain>Can I use US money in Spain?</h2>
<p>The euro is the only currency accepted in Spain, and it is unlikely you’ll be able to use anything else, even in the airport. Most ATMs in Spain take foreign cards, including VISA, Cirrus, Citibank, and American Express.</p>
<h2 id=how-many-days-do-you-need-to-visit-spain>How many days do you need to visit Spain?</h2>
<p>However, we recommend a minimum of seven days when it comes to Spain itineraries as this is just enough time to visit two destinations in one trip (like Madrid and Barcelona, or Seville and Granada).</p>
<h2 id=how-much-does-it-cost-to-go-to-spain>How much does it cost to go to Spain?</h2>
<p>While Spain can certainly seem more expensive if visiting popular places such as Barcelona or Madrid, it is still possible to visit on a budget with an average trip to Spain cost being around €55-60 per day.</p>
<h2 id=which-is-the-most-expensive-place-to-stay-in-spain>Which is the most expensive place to stay in Spain?</h2>
<p>With an average one-night bill of £182.70, Barcelona is nearly double the cost of Lugo, the most affordable destination in Spain. MOST EXPENSIVE STAYS. BIGGEST BARGAIN BREAKS. The study compared the cost of a one-night stay in a four-star hotel plus cocktails, a two-course dinner with a bottle of wine and transportation in a taxi.</p>
<h2 id=how-many-public-holidays-are-there-in-spain>How many public holidays are there in Spain?</h2>
<p>Public holidays celebrated in Spain include a mix of religious (Roman Catholic), national and regional observances. Each municipality is allowed to have a maximum of 13 public holidays per year; a maximum of nine of these are chosen by the national government and at least two are chosen locally.</p>
