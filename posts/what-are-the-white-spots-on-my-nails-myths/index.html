<h2 id=what-are-the-white-spots-on-my-nails-myths>What are the white spots on my nails myths?</h2>
<p>“Those white spots or bands are called Leukonychia, and the most common causes of these are commonly traumatic in origin,” dermatologist Dr John Sullivan tells Coach. “It’s where trauma (like a harsh knock or bump) has occurred to where the nail is forming near the base, and it grows out.”</p>
<h2 id=can-iron-deficiency-cause-white-spots-on-nails>Can iron deficiency cause white spots on nails?</h2>
<p>This disorder is associated with iron deficiency anemia. Leukonychia is white streaks or spots on the nails often due to drugs or disease. Pitting is the presence of small depressions on the nail surface. Sometimes the nail is also crumbling.</p>
<h2 id=how-do-you-get-rid-of-white-spots-on-nail-polish>How do you get rid of white spots on nail polish?</h2>
<p>Removed Your Toenail Polish and Have White Chalky Patches?</p>
<ol>
<li>If your nails are not super thin then use CND’s Girlfriend Buffer to very lightly buff away some of the white chalky appearance. Use all sides of the buffer to help seal the nail surface.</li>
<li>Now it is time to deeply hydrate and repair your nail plate.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id=what-do-half-moons-on-fingernails-mean>What do half moons on fingernails mean?</h2>
<p>Pyramidal lunula occurs when the moons of your fingernail form in a triangle shape. Most often, this is caused by an improper manicure or another kind of trauma to the fingernail. The moons may stay this way until the nail grows out and the tissue fully heals.</p>
<h2 id=what-do-white-vertical-lines-on-nails-mean>What do white vertical lines on nails mean?</h2>
<p>The vertical lines running from the cuticle to the top of the nail are nothing to be worried about. In most cases, such longitudinal ridging is simply a side effect of the normal aging process of nails. In addition, nails often lose their luster as they age and may appear opalescent and dull.</p>
<h2 id=what-do-fingernails-look-like-with-liver-disease>What do fingernails look like with liver disease?</h2>
<p>If the nails are mostly white with darker rims, this can indicate liver problems, such as hepatitis. In this image, you can see the fingers are also jaundiced, another sign of liver trouble.</p>
<h2 id=what-do-white-spots-on-your-fingernails-indicate>What do white spots on your fingernails indicate?</h2>
<p>You may notice white spots or dots along your nails if you are deficient in certain minerals or vitamins. The deficiencies most commonly linked to this issue are zinc deficiency and calcium deficiency.</p>
<h2 id=can-leaving-nail-polish-on-too-long-cause-fungus>Can leaving nail polish on too long cause fungus?</h2>
<p>The danger with keeping your nail polish on too long is that the pigment in the nail polish can soak into the top few layers of the nail and dry it out, Dr. Rowland says. When that happens, fungus, yeast, bacteria, mold and mildew can develop underneath the nail plate, which can lead to long-term problems.</p>
<h2 id=why-do-i-only-have-lunula-on-my-thumbs>Why do I only have lunula on my thumbs?</h2>
<p>Sometimes, you may only be able to see lunula on your thumbs, or possibly not on any fingers at all. In these cases, the lunula is most likely hidden under your skin. Though the connection is not completely understood, an absent lunula can indicate anemia, malnutrition, and depression.</p>
<h2 id=what-do-healthy-nails-look-like>What do healthy nails look like?</h2>
<p>Healthy fingernails are smooth, without pits or grooves. They’re uniform in color and consistency and free of spots or discoloration. Sometimes fingernails develop harmless vertical ridges that run from the cuticle to the tip of the nail. Vertical ridges tend to become more prominent with age.</p>
<h2 id=what-vitamin-helps-with-nail-ridges>What vitamin helps with nail ridges?</h2>
<p>1. Take biotin. Biotin is an important type of B vitamin that allows the body to turn food into energy. It’s also highly recommended as a supplement to help boost the strength of hair and nails.</p>
