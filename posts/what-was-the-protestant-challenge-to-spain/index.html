<h2 id=what-was-the-protestant-challenge-to-spain>What was the Protestant challenge to Spain?</h2>
<p>The Protestant Challenge to Spain●Spain struggled to hold on to some of their dominions, especially in the Eastern Caribbean which provided safe havens for pirates and privateers. King Philip II of Spain was determined to root out challenges to the Catholic Church.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-the-protestant-reformation-affect-spain>How did the Protestant Reformation affect Spain?</h2>
<p>Protestantism has had a very minor impact on Spanish life since the Reformation of the 16th century, owing to the intolerance of the Spanish government towards any non-Catholic religion and the Spanish Inquisition. 92% of Spain’s 8,131 villages do not have an evangelical Protestant church.</p>
<h2 id=what-caused-the-decline-of-spain>What caused the decline of Spain?</h2>
<p>Many different factors, including the decentralized political nature of Spain, inefficient taxation, a succession of weak kings, power struggles in the Spanish court and a tendency to focus on the American colonies instead of Spain’s domestic economy, all contributed to the decline of the Habsburg rule of Spain.</p>
<h2 id=what-were-some-of-the-difficulties-the-spanish-had>What were some of the difficulties the Spanish had?</h2>
<p>Disease, hunger, and poor relationships with local natives all contributed to the colony’s high death toll. George Percy, who served twice as governor of Jamestown, kept records of the colonists’ first months in the colony. These records were later published in London in 1608.</p>
<h2 id=are-there-any-protestants-in-spain>Are there any Protestants in Spain?</h2>
<p>There are about 30,000 Protestants in Spain, in a population of 28 million. Roman Catholicism is the official state religion. Protestants are permitted private worship, but must show no public manifestations of their faith.</p>
<h2 id=did-spain-support-the-protestant-reformation>Did Spain support the Protestant Reformation?</h2>
<p>Answer Expert Verified. The reason why Spain supported the Spanish Inquisition following the protestant reformation was because the Reformation was a large threat to the Catholic Church, was was still dominant.</p>
<h2 id=when-did-spain-decline>When did Spain decline?</h2>
<p>Philip secured Portugal and its empire in 1580–1 and in 1588 launched an attempt to conquer England – the Spanish Armada – which almost succeeded. Nevertheless, the Armada’s failure is widely regarded as a turning point, the beginning of a decline which became pronounced in the seventeenth century.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-weakness-of-spain-in-1600>What was the weakness of Spain in 1600?</h2>
<p>They saw clearly the central weakness of Spain: the attitude of mind that despised productive work and those who engaged in it. Far too many strove to live the life of a hidalgo.</p>
<h2 id=who-was-in-power-in-spain-in-the-17th-century>Who was in power in Spain in the 17th century?</h2>
<p>Habsburg Spain was at the height of its power and cultural influence at the beginning of the 17th century, but military, political, and economic difficulties were already being discussed within Spain.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-result-of-the-war-of-the-spanish-succession>What was the result of the War of the Spanish Succession?</h2>
<p>In the later 17th century, however, Spanish power began to decline, and after the death of the last Habsburg ruler, the War of the Spanish Succession ended with the relegation of Spain, now under Bourbon rule, to the status of a second-rate power with a reduced influence in European affairs.</p>
<h2 id=why-did-the-dutch-revolt-against-the-spanish>Why did the Dutch Revolt against the Spanish?</h2>
<p>The Netherlands were ruled by Spain but the English saw the Netherlands as a vital place for trade.

King Philip of Spain sent an army…</p>
