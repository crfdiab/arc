<h2 id=how-many-trees-does-canada-cut-down-a-year>How many trees does Canada cut down a year?</h2>
<p>Every year, Canada clearcuts a million acres of boreal forest, or seven NHL hockey rinks per minute. From 2001 to 2017, Canada lost nearly 40 million hectares of forest — releasing huge amounts of carbon into the atmosphere equivalent to the annual emissions of nearly 321 million cars.</p>
<h2 id=how-many-trees-get-chopped-down-in-a-year>How many trees get chopped down in a year?</h2>
<p>15 billion trees<br>
Roughly 15 billion trees are cut down each year, the researchers estimate; since the onset of human civilization, the global number of trees has dropped by roughly 46%.</p>
<h2 id=how-many-trees-are-cut-down-each-year-due-to-deforestation>How many trees are cut down each year due to deforestation?</h2>
<p>Just how many trees are being cut each year and where, or how are they being used? Between 3.5 billion to 7 billion trees are being cut every year according to a report published by the Rainforest Action Network (RAN).</p>
<h2 id=how-many-trees-are-cut-down-each-year-in-the-world>How many trees are cut down each year in the world?</h2>
<p>When it comes to the world’s forests, two of the commonly asked questions are “How many trees are are on Earth?” and “How many trees are cut down each year?” A new study proposes answers: three trillion and 15.3 billion.</p>
<h2 id=why-do-we-have-to-cut-down-trees>Why do we have to cut down trees?</h2>
<p>Trees are not only cut down to make wood byproducts, but they are also cut down to maintain the health of forests. Small trees that are more susceptible to drought, invasive species and disease are often removed to prevent the spread of these infestations to mature forests.</p>
<h2 id=how-many-trees-are-there-in-the-world>How many trees are there in the world?</h2>
<p>A study published on September 2, 2015 in the journal Nature suggests these answers: 3 trillion and 15.3 billion. The research’s results are based on a combination of on-the-ground inventories, satellite imagery, and computer modeling. Previous estimate said Earth still has around 400 billion trees, so the 3 trillion figure is quite a jump.</p>
<h2 id=how-many-trees-are-lost-a-year-due-to-deforestation>How many trees are lost a year due to deforestation?</h2>
<p>Over 1.3 million is lost a year. The loss of tree cover has a number of negative effects on the planet. Seventy percent of the world’s plants and animals live in forests. When habitats are lost because of deforestation, it puts pressure on a large number of species and is the direct cause of extinctions.</p>
