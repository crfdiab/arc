<p>Hyde Park<br>
The Anzac Memorial, in Sydney’s Hyde Park, is New South Wale’s principal memorial to all Australians who have served in…</p>
<h2 id=how-do-we-acknowledge-anzac-day>How do we acknowledge Anzac Day?</h2>
<p>Aus: On Anzac Day we remember and honour the service and sacrifice of those who have served our nations. – To acknowledge those who have died in service to our nations. – To reflect on how that service and sacrifice has contributed to what and who we are as nations today — that is, to understand its impact.</p>
<h2 id=is-there-2-up-in-2021>Is there 2 up in 2021?</h2>
<p>Eased coronavirus restrictions across Australia means that the famed and fabled Anzac Day tradition of two-up will return to local pubs and clubs in 2021.</p>
<h2 id=where-was-the-first-anzac-day-ceremony-held>Where was the first Anzac Day ceremony held?</h2>
<p>1916: The first Anzac Day. Australian and New Zealand soldiers marching to Westminster Abbey, London, to commemorate the first Anzac Day, 25 April 1916. On 25 April 1916, small ceremonies were held around the world and throughout Australia to commemorate the Anzacs’ entrance into the war, and the lives of their fallen comrades.</p>
<h2 id=why-was-there-no-memorial-service-on-anzac-day>Why was there no memorial service on Anzac Day?</h2>
<p>At the time, government orders prohibited large public gatherings in case of a Japanese air attack, so it was a small occasion with neither a march nor a memorial service. Since then, Anzac Day has been commemorated at the Memorial every year.</p>
<h2 id=when-is-anzac-day-in-australia-and-new-zealand>When is Anzac Day in Australia and New Zealand?</h2>
<p>From 1916 onwards, in both Australia and New Zealand, Anzac memorials were held on or about 25 April, mainly organised by returned servicemen and school children in cooperation with local authorities. Early morning services were solemn, with a more upbeat tone set for honouring returned soldiers during afternoon activities.</p>
<h2 id=how-many-people-were-at-cenotaph-on-anzac-day>How many people were at Cenotaph on Anzac Day?</h2>
<p>Some 150 people gathered at the Cenotaph in 1928 for a wreathlaying and two minutes’ silence. This is generally regarded as the beginning of organised dawn services. Over the years the ceremonies have developed into their modern forms and have seen an increased association with the dawn landings of 25 April 1915.</p>
