<h2 id=what-is-the-government-system-in-france>What is the government system in France?</h2>
<p>France has a semi-presidential system of government, with both a President and a Prime Minister. The Prime Minister is responsible to the French Parliament.</p>
<h2 id=what-nations-have-a-multiparty-system-of-government>What nations have a multiparty system of government?</h2>
<p>Good examples of countries that have this system include Brazil, Denmark, Finland, Germany, Iceland, India, Indonesia, Ireland, Israel, Italy, Mexico, The Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Pakistan, Portugal, Romania, Serbia, South Africa, Spain, Sri Lanka, Sweden, Taiwan, Philippines, and South Korea.</p>
<h2 id=what-5-nations-have-a-multiparty-system>What 5 nations have a multiparty system?</h2>
<p>Argentina, Armenia, Belgium, Brazil, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Iceland, India, Indonesia, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, the Philippines, Poland, Sweden, Tunisia, and Ukraine are examples of nations that have used a multi-party system effectively in their democracies.</p>
<h2 id=does-japan-have-a-multiparty-system-of-government>Does Japan have a multiparty system of government?</h2>
<p>The politics of Japan are conducted in a framework of a multi-party bicameral parliamentary representative democratic constitutional monarchy in which the Emperor is the Head of State and the Prime Minister is the Head of Government and the Head of the Cabinet, which directs the executive branch.</p>
<h2 id=what-political-system-is-germany>What political system is Germany?</h2>
<p>1.1 Germany is a federal parliamentary democracy governed under the Basic Law for the Federal Republic of Germany (“Basic Law”), the Constitution of Germany. The Basic Law consists of 11 chapters which set out the rights of the German people and outline in considerable detail the political and legal system of Germany.</p>
<h2 id=when-did-the-french-become-a-democracy>When did the French become a democracy?</h2>
<p>After about 800 years of rule by a king, the French staged a revolution in 1789 and proclaimed the first republic in 1792.</p>
<h2 id=how-long-has-france-been-a-multi-party-system>How long has France been a multi party system?</h2>
<p>Loading… France has had multi-party systems since the very first parliamentary election in 1791. While political parties as we know them today didn’t really exist, parliamentarians at that time broadly fell into three factions, Marais, Feuillants, and Jacobins.</p>
<h2 id=how-does-a-multiparty-system-of-government-work>How does a multiparty system of government work?</h2>
<p>A multi-party system is a system in which multiple political parties across the political spectrum run for national election, and all have the capacity to gain control of government offices, separately or in coalition. In these countries, usually no single party has a parliamentary majority by itself.</p>
<h2 id=which-is-better-multi-party-system-or-one-party-system>Which is better multi party system or one party system?</h2>
<p>Nonetheless, multi party system also has it disadvantages too. The arguments against the system contributes to the reasons why most countries prefer a one party or two party system to a multi party system.</p>
<h2 id=what-happens-when-two-parties-form-a-government>What happens when two parties form a government?</h2>
<p>The inability of one party to win a clear cut majority of seats in the parliament leads to the formation of a coalition government. That is, a government formed by two or more parties that come together as a result of the inability of non of the existing parties to win a clear cut majority seats in the parliament.</p>
