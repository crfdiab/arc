<p>Woodland today covers 13.2% (3.2 million ha) of the UK’s land surface, up from 12% cover in 1998. Half of this is native tree species, the other half is mainly non-native commercial conifer plantation. Just 7% of Britain’s native woodlands are currently in good ecological condition.</p>

<p>The CCC analysis outlines that 32,000 hectares annually of net woodland increase is required for the next 30 years, moving the UK from 13% to 17% woodland cover. This equates to a million new hectares of woodland cover, and some 1.5 billion trees. Beccy Speight, CEO, Woodland Trust said: “There is a potential win-win here.</p>
<h2 id=are-there-trees-in-great-britain-and-ireland>Are there trees in Great Britain and Ireland?</h2>
<p>There are a number of issues surrounding the inclusion of a species in such a list. As can be seen from the outline of debate below, there is no ‘correct’ list of trees of Britain and Ireland.</p>
<h2 id=how-many-trees-are-planted-in-scotland-each-year>How many trees are planted in Scotland each year?</h2>
<p>Forest and woodland currently cover about 18% of Scotland, and the Scottish government intends to increase that to 21% by 2032. Its current target is to plant 10,000 hectares of new woodland every year, rising to 15,000 per year by 2024-25.</p>
<h2 id=how-big-is-the-forest-in-the-uk>How big is the forest in the UK?</h2>
