<h2 id=where-does-the-river-flow-through>Where does the river flow through?</h2>
<p>The other end of a river is called its mouth, where water empties into a larger body of water, such as a lake or ocean. Along the way, rivers may pass through wetlands where plants slow down the water and filter out pollutants.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-name-of-what-a-river-flows-in>What is the name of what a river flows in?</h2>
<p>A tributary or affluent is a stream or river that flows into a larger stream or main stem (or parent) river or a lake. A tributary does not flow directly into a sea or ocean.</p>
<h2 id=do-rivers-flow-east-or-west>Do rivers flow east or west?</h2>
<p>In South America, the amazon flows East, and most rivers south of there also flow east. The western side of the continent (from the divide) is very small, so not much water flows West. So, the average is definitely East.</p>
<h2 id=do-rivers-flow-north>Do rivers flow north?</h2>
<p>Rivers flow in one direction all over the world, and that direction is downhill. Across the central and eastern United States, it is rare for rivers to flow north because the slope of the land is toward the south and east.</p>
<h2 id=where-does-the-water-from-a-river-go>Where does the water from a river go?</h2>
<p>The fertilisers used on crops seep into the soil and enter the underground water supply. This then flows into rivers, which flow into the sea. Fertilisers contain lots of nitrogen and this is great for growing plants – they love the stuff.</p>
<h2 id=where-do-the-rivers-of-the-united-states-flow-into>Where do the rivers of the United States flow into?</h2>
<p>East of the Rocky Mountains and north of the Canada-U.S. border, the rivers flow into the Arctic Ocean. Most rivers of the central U.S. flow into the Gulf of Mexico via the Mississippi River.</p>
<h2 id=where-does-the-river-flow-under-your-feet>Where does the river flow under your feet?</h2>
<p>If you are standing on the bank of a river, the river may well be flowing under your feet. This area underground where the river flows is called the hyporheic zone(hy-po-ree-ik). In the hyporheic zone, many forms of life can be found.</p>
<h2 id=are-there-any-rivers-that-drain-into-the-atlantic-ocean>Are there any rivers that drain into the Atlantic Ocean?</h2>
<p>Most rivers of the central U.S. flow into the Gulf of Mexicovia the Mississippi River. Indirectly, this is an Atlantic Ocean drainage. Rivers on the east side of Mexico and Central America also drain into the Gulf of Mexico. Rivers around the Great Lakesand along the entire east coast of Canada and the U.S. flow directly into the Atlantic Ocean.</p>
