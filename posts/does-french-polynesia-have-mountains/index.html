<h2 id=does-french-polynesia-have-mountains>Does French Polynesia have mountains?</h2>
<p>Tahiti Nui is dominated by three extinct volcanic mountains including Mount Orohena, the tallest in French Polynesia; Mount Aorai, known for its incredible views; and Le Diadème, which appears to crown the island as the rightful queen.</p>
<h2 id=is-it-illegal-to-swim-in-french-polynesia>Is it illegal to swim in French Polynesia?</h2>
<p>Yes you can swim, there are no restrictions to that, however its not as great as swimming off Moorea or Bora bora, the water isnt that clear in Tahiti.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-french-polynesia-famous-for>What is French Polynesia famous for?</h2>
<p>French Polynesia is internationally known for diving. Each archipelago offers opportunities for divers. Rangiroa and Fakarava in the Tuamotu islands are the most famous spots in the area.</p>
<h2 id=does-polynesia-have-snow>Does Polynesia have snow?</h2>
<p>When can you find snow in Tahiti? Weather stations report no annual snow.</p>
<h2 id=how-safe-is-french-polynesia>How safe is French Polynesia?</h2>
<p>The crime rate is incredibly low in French Polynesia, however there are natural hazards and local laws to be aware of. Here’s what you need to know before you visit the French Polynesian islands. COVID-19 travel restrictions: Click here to find out about entry requirements for travelers to French Polynesia.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-best-time-to-visit-french-polynesia>What is the best time to visit French Polynesia?</h2>
<p>French Polynesia is at its best between June and August when the climate is at its driest and the weather is balmy, sitting comfortably in the high 70s to mid 90s Fahrenheit. However, this can be a slightly busier time of year and the months either side of this period can see comfortable temperatures, but lower prices.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-rainy-season-in-tahiti>What is the rainy season in Tahiti?</h2>
<p>While the rainy season typically lasts from November to April, is a little warmer (between 77°F and 95°F/25°C and 35°C), and subject to tropical showers, which rarely last longer than 30 minutes.</p>
<h2 id=how-tall-are-the-mountains-in-tahiti-french-polynesia>How tall are the mountains in Tahiti French Polynesia?</h2>
<p>Heavy tropical rains have carved deep valleys, some with nearly vertical walls up to 1,000 meters (3,000 feet) tall. The angled sunlight in this image brightens some slopes, while leaving others in shadow. Tahiti’s sharp relief has complicated the geological surveys because they cause so much erosion.</p>
<h2 id=how-are-the-marquesas-islands-different-from-other-french-polynesia-islands>How are the Marquesas Islands different from other French Polynesia islands?</h2>
<p>Unlike the other islands in French Polynesia, there are no lagoons or protected coral reefs surrounding these landscapes. Instead, steep volcanic mountains plunge straight into the pounding Pacific Ocean, while jagged ridges lay interspersed between deep valleys and thriving jungles.</p>
<h2 id=which-is-the-most-scenic-island-in-french-polynesia>Which is the most scenic island in French Polynesia?</h2>
<p>Believed to have inspired the mythical Bali Hai from James Michener’s Tales of the South Pacific, Moorea is one of the most scenically striking islands in French Polynesia.</p>
<h2 id=how-many-islands-are-there-in-french-polynesia>How many islands are there in French Polynesia?</h2>
<p>The name can either refer to the main island or the entire destination. Commonly referred to as The Islands of Tahiti, French Polynesia is a collection of 118 islands and atolls scattered across an impressive nautical surface area the size of Western Europe.</p>
