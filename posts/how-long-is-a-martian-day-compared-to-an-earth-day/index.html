<h2 id=how-long-is-a-martian-day-compared-to-an-earth-day>How long is a Martian day compared to an Earth day?</h2>
<p>How long is a day and year on Mars? Mars is a planet with a very similar daily cycle to the Earth. Its sidereal day is 24 hours, 37 minutes and 22 seconds, and its solar day 24 hours, 39 minutes and 35 seconds. A Martian day (referred to as “sol”) is therefore approximately 40 minutes longer than a day on Earth.</p>
<h2 id=how-long-is-a-day-on-mars-in-earth-years>How long is a day on Mars in Earth years?</h2>
<p>A sol is slightly longer than an Earth day. It is approximately 24 hours, 39 minutes, 35 seconds long. A Martian year is approximately 668 sols, equivalent to approximately 687 Earth days or 1.88 Earth years.</p>
<h2 id=why-is-a-martian-day-called-a-sol>Why is a Martian day called a sol?</h2>
<p>A Mars solar day has a mean period of 24 hours 39 minutes 35.244 seconds, and is customarily referred to as a “sol” in order to distinguish this from the roughly 3% shorter solar day on Earth.</p>
<h2 id=how-long-is-martian-night>How long is Martian night?</h2>
<p>On Mars, a solar day lasts 24 hours, 39 minutes, and 35 seconds. Rounding that out, we say that a day here on Earth works out to an even 24 hours while on Mars, a day lasts 24 hours and 40 minutes.</p>
<h2 id=is-it-true-you-dont-age-in-space>Is it true you don’t age in space?</h2>
<p>We all measure our experience in space-time differently. That’s because space-time isn’t flat — it’s curved, and it can be warped by matter and energy. And for astronauts on the International Space Station, that means they get to age just a tiny bit slower than people on Earth. That’s because of time-dilation effects.</p>
<h2 id=how-long-is-1-day-in-space>How long is 1 day in space?</h2>
<p>23 hours and 56 minutes<br>
The definition of a day is the amount of time it takes an astronomical object to complete one full spin on its axis. On Earth, a day is 23 hours and 56 minutes, but other planets and bodies rotate at different rates….The Earth is the only planet with an approximately 24-hour day.</p>

<h2 id=how-long-is-a-martian-day-compared-to-an-earth-day-1>How long is a Martian day compared to an Earth Day?</h2>
<p>The Martian day is only slightly longer than one on Earth, at 24 hours and 39 minutes. How does the length of martian day and year compare to Earth’s day and year? There are different definitions for day, but on average the Martian day is 38 minutes longer than the Earth day.</p>
<h2 id=how-long-is-a-solar-day-on-mars>How long is a solar day on Mars?</h2>
<p>This position changes slightly each day, but on Earth, a mean solar day works out to being 24 hours long. On Mars, a solar day lasts 24 hours, 39 minutes, and 35 seconds.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-time-in-mars>What is the time in Mars?</h2>
<p>By definition, a sidereal day on Mars is the length of time that it takes the planet to rotate once on its axis so that stars appear in the same place in the night sky. On Earth, this takes exactly 23 hours, 56 minutes and 4.1 seconds.</p>
<h2 id=how-long-is-one-day-on-mar>How long is one day on Mar?</h2>
