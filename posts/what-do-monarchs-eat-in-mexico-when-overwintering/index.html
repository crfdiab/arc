<h2 id=what-do-monarchs-eat-in-mexico-when-overwintering>What do monarchs eat in Mexico when overwintering?</h2>
<p>Monarchs need to consume enough milkweed as caterpillars and nectar as adults before reaching the overwintering sites so that they do not need to eat to survive while they are overwintering.</p>
<h2 id=what-features-make-mexico-a-good-winter-habitat-for-monarch-butterflies>What features make Mexico a good winter habitat for monarch butterflies?</h2>
<p>Overwintering in Mexico Monarchs roost for the winter in oyamel fir forests at an elevation of 2,400 to 3,600 meters (nearly 2 miles above sea level). The mountain hillsides of oyamel forest provide an ideal microclimate for the butterflies. Here temperatures range from 0 to 15 degrees Celsius.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-some-of-the-needs-of-monarchs-during-their-migration>What are some of the needs of monarchs during their migration?</h2>
<p>Monarchs that are preparing to migrate south to Mexico need to consume enough nectar to build up fat reserves. The food they eat before and during their migration south must not only power them through the long journey, but also must sustain them throughout the winter.</p>
<h2 id=how-do-monarchs-overwinter>How do monarchs overwinter?</h2>
<p>Monarchs migrate to the mountains of central Mexico, or the Pacific Coast to overwinter in areas that are warm enough for them to spend the winter without freezing, but cool enough for them to not use all their energy when there isn’t much food to eat.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-longest-living-butterfly>What is the longest living butterfly?</h2>
<p>Brimstone Butterfly<br>
The longest living species in the world is the Brimstone Butterfly – up to 13 months!</p>
<h2 id=what-is-a-monarch-butterflys-favorite-food>What is a monarch butterfly’s favorite food?</h2>
<p>Many flowers — especially native plants — are terrific sources of nectar for monarch butterflies, but milkweed leaves are the only food monarch caterpillars eat.</p>
<h2 id=where-do-the-monarchs-spend-the-winter>Where do the monarchs spend the winter?</h2>
<p>Mexico<br>
Most Monarchs spend the winter in Mexico where they have the uncanny ability to find the same Oyamel fir tree where generations before it spent their winters. If Monarchs live west of the Rockies, they migrate to Pacific Grove, California where it hibernates in eucalyptus trees.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-lifespan-of-butterfly>What is the lifespan of butterfly?</h2>
<p>Painted lady: 12 months<br>

<h2 id=where-do-monarchs-go-to-overwinter-in-mexico>Where do monarchs go to overwinter in Mexico?</h2>
<p>The butterflies that overwinter in Mexico are the primary seed stock of all future migratory monarchs. Emphasize size: Notice how small the over-wintering region is, and how little of the area has suitable habitat for monarchs!</p>
<h2 id=where-do-monarchs-spend-the-winter-in-north-america>Where do Monarchs spend the winter in North America?</h2>
<p>North America’s monarchs spend the winter–together–in an astonishingly small region. The butterflies that overwinter in Mexico are the primary seed stock of all future migratory monarchs. Emphasize size: Notice how small the over-wintering region is, and how little of the area has suitable habitat for monarchs!</p>
<h2 id=why-are-monarch-butterfly-reserves-important-to-mexico>Why are monarch butterfly reserves important to Mexico?</h2>
<p>Visiting the monarch butterfly reserves offers the visitor a chance to witness a wonder of nature. Being surrounded by thousands of fluttering butterflies and seeing them carpeting the forest floor and weighing down the branches of the trees is truly a remarkable experience.</p>
<h2 id=what-kind-of-plants-do-monarchs-live-on>What kind of plants do monarchs live on?</h2>
<p>Like all monarchs, this generation begins life on plants in the genus Asclepias, these are species of milkweed. The most important host plants for Generation 1 monarchs in the southern US are Asclepias oenotheroides, A. viridis and A. asperula. Monarchs in Generation 2 are the grandchildren of the overwintering monarchs.</p>
