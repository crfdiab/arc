<h2 id=what-effects-do-the-great-lakes-have-on-our-region>What effects do the Great Lakes have on our region?</h2>
<p>The Great Lakes are large enough to themselves influence weather in the region. The Lakes moderate temperatures throughout the year, helping to cool nearby lands in the summer and warm them in winter. Their humidity feeds cloud cover and precipitation both over the lakes and downwind.</p>
<h2 id=what-made-the-great-lakes-tribes-more-mobile>What made the Great Lakes tribes more mobile?</h2>
<p>Intermarriage and Economic Change These intermarriages are one reason that so many Indians in Wisconsin and the Great Lakes have European, and especially French last names today. Rather than living in large villages, Indian people began to spread out over wider areas and live in smaller, more mobile settlements.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-the-problems-in-the-great-lakes-region>What are the problems in the Great Lakes region?</h2>
<p>While international organizations and governments are active in peace initiatives in the Great Lakes region, issues of land ownership, ethnicity, and reconciliation after genocide, extreme poverty, and underrepresentation need synthesis between bottom-up approaches and top-down approaches to peacebuilding.</p>
<h2 id=who-is-involved-in-the-great-lakes-region>Who is involved in the Great Lakes region?</h2>
<p>Regional and international organizations, mainly the Organization of African Union and the United Nations, have been on the front lines in responding to the cycle of conflict in the Great Lakes region.</p>
<h2 id=how-many-people-depend-on-the-great-lakes>How many people depend on the Great Lakes?</h2>
<p>Forty million residents of the United States and Canada depend on this system for clean drinking water. SeaWiFS satellite captured this view of the Great Lakes, including the turbid waters of Lake Erie, in this recent overpass.</p>
<h2 id=where-did-the-great-lakes-region-get-its-name>Where did the Great Lakes region get its name?</h2>
<p>The name, “Great Lakes Region” was derived from the fresh water lakes and river basins within the Central and Eastern part of Africa.[1] However, the term now refers to a region with interlinked conflicts and common fundamental problems that emanate from post-colonial challenges to state- and nation-building.</p>
