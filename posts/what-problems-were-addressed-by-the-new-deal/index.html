<h2 id=what-problems-were-addressed-by-the-new-deal>What problems were addressed by the New Deal?</h2>
<p>The programs focused on what historians refer to as the “3 R’s”: relief for the unemployed and poor, recovery of the economy back to normal levels, and reform of the financial system to prevent a repeat depression.</p>
<h2 id=why-did-people-oppose-fdrs-new-deal-quizlet>Why did people oppose FDR’s New Deal quizlet?</h2>
<p>Reasons for opposing the New Deal: They were wealthy and opposed the increase in taxes required to fund the New Deal policies. Too much government interference in the economy and people’s lives smothered enterprise. They believed it to be akin to Communism as the state had so much control.</p>
<h2 id=what-impact-did-the-new-deal-have-on-america>What impact did the New Deal have on America?</h2>
<p>In the short term, New Deal programs helped improve the lives of people suffering from the events of the depression. In the long run, New Deal programs set a precedent for the federal government to play a key role in the economic and social affairs of the nation.</p>
<h2 id=who-criticized-the-new-deal-quizlet>Who criticized the New Deal quizlet?</h2>
<p>consisted of Rep. business leaders and conservative Dem. You just studied 6 terms!</p>
<h2 id=who-are-the-critics-of-the-new-deal>Who are the critics of the New Deal?</h2>
<p>Critics of the New Deal Opponents of the New Deal ~ or ~ FDR’s Alphabet Soup for the Nation’s Soul Steven S. Gordon Esq. There were many people and groups who opposed the Franklin Delano Roosevelt’s New Deal. Huey Long, an early supporter of FDR, turned against him and the New Deal claiming that it was too beholden to big business.</p>
<h2 id=why-was-the-new-deal-bad-for-business>Why was the New Deal bad for business?</h2>
<p>Some critics have charged that the New Deal was anti business and anti-free enterprise. Explain why you agree or disagree with this charge. Agree: the New Deal weakened free enterprise business by increasing regulations, taxes, union membership, and wages. Disagree: increased government spending, improved economy,…</p>
<h2 id=how-did-the-new-deal-end-the-great-depression>How did the New Deal end the Great Depression?</h2>
<p>Employment levels did not reach those which had existed prior to 1929 until the outbreak of World War II. So, although the New Deal gave people hope, its program of Relief, Recovery and Reform did little to end the Great Depression other than push the country into more debt.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-opposition-to-the-new-deal>What was the opposition to the New Deal?</h2>
<p>One source of opposition that must have been a surprise to Roosevelt came from within his own government in the form of the Supreme Court. Roosevelt inherited a nation in dire straights. Up to 30% of the country was unemployed. Banks, businesses, and factories were closing at astonishing rates.</p>
