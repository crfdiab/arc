<h2 id=who-was-in-the-directory>Who was in the directory?</h2>
<p>Who were members of the Directory? The Directory consisted of an executive branch called the “Five Directors” and a legislative branch called the “Corps Legislatif.” The Corps Legislatif was divided into two houses: the Council of Five Hundred and the Council of Ancients.</p>
<h2 id=who-was-maximilien-robespierre-french-revolution>Who was Maximilien Robespierre French Revolution?</h2>
<p>Maximilien Robespierre was a radical democrat and key figure in the French Revolution of 1789. Robespierre briefly presided over the influential Jacobin Club, a political club based in Paris. He also served as president of the National Convention and on the Committee of Public Safety.</p>
<h2 id=what-happened-to-the-king-and-queen-of-france-during-the-revolution>What happened to the King and Queen of France during the Revolution?</h2>
<p>In Revolutionary France, the Legislative Assembly votes to abolish the monarchy and establish the First Republic. King Louis and his queen, Mary-Antoinette, were imprisoned in August 1792, and in September the monarchy was abolished.</p>
<h2 id=why-did-the-left-and-right-oppose-the-seating-arrangement>Why did the left and right oppose the seating arrangement?</h2>
<p>However, the Right opposed the seating arrangement because they believed that deputies should support private or general interests, but should not form factions or political parties. The contemporary press occasionally used the terms “left” and “right” to describe the opposing sides.</p>
<h2 id=where-did-the-term-left-and-right-come-from>Where did the term left and right come from?</h2>
<p>The opening chapter of the book describes the French origins of the terms in vital detail. The division between the left and right during the English, American, and French Revolutions tell us everything we need to know about the political left-wing and political right-wing as absolute and comparative terms.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-left-called-during-the-french-revolution>What was the left called during the French Revolution?</h2>
<p>The Left had been called “the party of movement” and the Right “the party of order.” During the French Revolution, the National Assembly was divided into supporters of the king and supporters of the revolution.</p>
<h2 id=why-are-the-left-and-right-parties-the-same>Why are the left and right parties the same?</h2>
<p>The original “Right” was always the party sector associated with the interests of the upper or dominant classes. This party supported aristocratic or royal interests, as well those of the Church. The conservative right defended entrenched prerogatives, privileges, and powers that the “Left” had attacked.</p>
