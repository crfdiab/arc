<h2 id=did-james-madison-make-the-federalist-papers>Did James Madison make The Federalist Papers?</h2>
<p>James Madison, America’s fourth President (1809-1817), made a major contribution to the ratification of the Constitution by writing The Federalist Papers, along with Alexander Hamilton and John Jay. In later years, he was referred to as the “Father of the Constitution.”</p>
<h2 id=what-did-james-madison-wrote-in-federalist-39>What did James Madison wrote in Federalist 39?</h2>

<h2 id=what-did-james-madison-express-in-the-federalist-papers>What did James Madison Express in The Federalist Papers?</h2>
<p>In this Federalist Paper, James Madison explains and defends the checks and balances system in the Constitution. Madison also discusses the way republican government can serve as a check on the power of factions, and the tyranny of the majority.</p>
<h2 id=which-branch-of-government-is-the-strongest-and-why>Which branch of government is the strongest and why?</h2>
<p>In conclusion, The Legislative Branch is the most powerful branch of the United States government not only because of the powers given to them by the Constitution, but also the implied powers that Congress has. There is also Congress’s ability to triumph over the Checks and balances that limits their power.</p>
<h2 id=how-many-essays-were-published-in-the-federalist-papers>How many essays were published in the Federalist Papers?</h2>
<p>Hamilton, Madison and Jay published the essays at a rapid pace. At times, three to four new essays by Publius appeared in the papers in a single week. Garry Wills observes that this fast pace of production “overwhelmed” any possible response: “Who, given ample time could have answered such a battery of arguments? And no time was given.”</p>
<h2 id=what-did-hamilton-write-in-the-federalist-papers>What did Hamilton write in the Federalist Papers?</h2>
<p>Federalist No. 78, also written by Hamilton, lays the groundwork for the doctrine of judicial review by federal courts of federal legislation or executive acts. Federalist No. 70 presents Hamilton’s case for a one-man chief executive.</p>
<h2 id=when-do-federal-judges-use-the-federalist-papers>When do federal judges use the Federalist Papers?</h2>
<p>Federal judges, when interpreting the Constitution, frequently use The Federalist Papers as a contemporary account of the intentions of the framers and ratifiers.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-duers-name-in-the-federalist-papers>What was Duer’s name in the Federalist Papers?</h2>
<p>However, Morris turned down the invitation, and Hamilton rejected three essays written by Duer. Duer later wrote in support of the three Federalist authors under the name “Philo-Publius,” or “Friend of Publius.”</p>
