<h2 id=what-factors-affect-the-size-of-crystals-that-form-as-magma-cools>What factors affect the size of crystals that form as magma cools?</h2>
<p>The size of crystals produced depends on the rate at which the magma cools. If cooling is very slow, minerals have lots of time to grow, and so large crystals are produced. If cooling is rapid, little time is available for growth, and so crystals will be small.</p>
<h2 id=what-would-happen-when-magma-is-cooled-and-crystallized>What would happen when magma is cooled and crystallized?</h2>
<p>When this fluid lava comes in contact with air or water, it cools and solidify to form extrusive igneous rock. Similarly, when debris blasted from a volcano accumulates and are welded or cemented together, they also form extrusive igneous rock.</p>
<h2 id=can-minerals-form-from-cooling-magma>Can minerals form from cooling magma?</h2>
<p>Minerals can form on the surface through evaporation of solutions containing dissolved minerals. Minerals can form beneath the surface when dissolved elements and compounds leave a hot water solution or when materials melted in magma/ lava then cools & hardens.</p>
<h2 id=how-does-cooling-time-affect-crystal-size>How does cooling time affect crystal size?</h2>
<p>As the rate of cooling increases, crystal size decreases. This means that something which cools very quickly will have smaller crystal formations, and something which cools slowly will have larger crystal formations.</p>
<h2 id=what-factors-affect-the-size-of-the-crystals-that-form-as-magma-cools-quizlet>What factors affect the size of the crystals that form as magma cools quizlet?</h2>
<p>What factors affect the size of the crystals that form as magma cools? The rate at which the magma cools, the amount of gas the magma contains, and the chemical composition of the magma all affect crystal size.</p>
<h2 id=which-minerals-are-the-first-to-crystallize-from-cooling-magma>Which minerals are the first to crystallize from cooling magma?</h2>
<p>Of the common silicate minerals, olivine normally crystallizes first, at between 1200° and 1300°C. As the temperature drops, and assuming that some silica remains in the magma, the olivine crystals will react (combine) with some of the silica in the magma to form pyroxene.</p>
<h2 id=how-are-crystals-formed-when-magma-cools-down>How are crystals formed when magma cools down?</h2>
<p>When magma cools, crystals form because the solution is super-saturated with respect to some minerals. If the magma cools quickly, the crystals do not have much time to form, so they are very small. If the magma cools slowly, then the crystals have enough time to grow and become large.</p>
<h2 id=how-does-the-cooling-rate-affect-the-size-of-a-crystal>How does the cooling rate affect the size of a crystal?</h2>
<p>Understand the effects of cooling rate on crystal size Understand how rapid cooling can lead to crystal fractionalization When magma cools, crystals form because the solution is super-saturated with respect to some minerals. If the magma cools quickly, the crystals do not have much time to form, so they are very small.</p>
<h2 id=how-are-minerals-formed-in-a-cooling-lava>How are minerals formed in a cooling lava?</h2>
<p>In a cooling lava, mineral crystals do not have time to form and are very small. The chemical composition will be the same as if the magma cooled slowly. Existing rocks may be heated enough so that the molecules are released from their structure and can move around.</p>
<h2 id=how-is-the-rate-of-cooling-of-magma-determined>How is the rate of cooling of magma determined?</h2>
<p>Rate of cooling depends on where magma cools. Most bodies of magma rising to the surface get emplaced (stuck) inside the earth’s crust. Igneous rocks that solidify within the crust are called “intrusive rocks” or “plutonic rocks” (named for Pluto, the Roman God of the Underworld). Emplaced bodies of intrusive rock are called “plutons”.</p>
