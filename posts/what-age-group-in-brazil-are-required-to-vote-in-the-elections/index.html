<h2 id=what-age-group-in-brazil-are-required-to-vote-in-the-elections>What age group in Brazil are required to vote in the elections?</h2>
<p>Brazil. Brazil lowered the voting age from 18 to 16 in the 1988 constitution. The presidential election of 1989 was the first with the lower voting age. People between the ages 18 and 70 are required to vote.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-voter-turnout-in-brazil>What is the voter turnout in Brazil?</h2>
<p>Turnout. 79.67% (first round)</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-suffrage-in-brazil>What is the suffrage in Brazil?</h2>
<p>Women were first allowed to vote in Brazil in 1932, but their political rights only became equal to men’s in 1945, when the vote became compulsory for both sexes. Women’s right to vote is often portrayed as a choice made by men who spontaneously decided to grant it to women as a favour.</p>
<h2 id=is-voting-in-belgium-compulsory>Is voting in Belgium compulsory?</h2>
<p>Voting is mandatory and all elections use proportional representation which in general requires coalition governments. The method of election, the elected bodies, and the political party system have changed drastically since the founding of Belgium in 1830.</p>
<h2 id=when-did-they-start-using-single-ballots-in-brazil>When did they start using single ballots in Brazil?</h2>
<p>Since 1966 unified single ballots have been used for simultaneous elections. In 1996 fifty-one of Brazil’s largest cities used a new electronic voting machine with great success. In 1998 some 90 million voters will use this new technique, which may become a hot export item.</p>
<h2 id=how-does-the-electoral-system-work-in-brazil>How does the electoral system work in Brazil?</h2>
<p>In proportional representation elections, voters have the option of making a party vote. Usually, however, the proportional representation campaigns are so individualized (many candidates never mention their party label in their propaganda) that the party vote is very small (8 percent in 1994).</p>
<h2 id=how-are-the-seats-allocated-in-the-brazilian-parliament>How are the seats allocated in the Brazilian parliament?</h2>
<p>Seats are allocated using a version of the D’Hondt method where only parties who receive at least V/n votes (where V is the total number of votes cast and n is the total number of seats to be filled) may win seats in the legislature. A presidential candidate in Brazil needs to gain fifty per cent plus one of votes to be named as winner.</p>
<h2 id=how-are-the-members-of-congress-elected-in-brazil>How are the members of Congress elected in Brazil?</h2>
<p>Elections in Brazil. The president is elected to a four-year term by absolute majority vote through a two-round system. The National Congress ( Congresso Nacional) has two chambers. The Chamber of Deputies ( Câmara dos Deputados) has 513 members, elected to a four-year term by proportional representation.</p>
