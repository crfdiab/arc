<h2 id=what-is-the-name-of-the-volcano-found-in-st-lucia>What is the name of the volcano found in St Lucia?</h2>
<p>Qualibou, also known as the Soufrière Volcanic Center, is a 3.5 X 5 km wide caldera on the island of Saint Lucia that formed approximately 32–39,000 years ago. This eruption also formed the Choiseul Tuff which covers the southeastern portion of the island.</p>
<h2 id=is-st-lucia-volcano-dangerous>Is St Lucia volcano dangerous?</h2>
<p>The least-likely scenario for a future eruption in Saint Lucia is a large explosive magmatic eruption from the Soufrière Volcanic Centre. This is also considered the “worst-case” scenario. Such an explosive eruption may last for years but could also be short-lived (weeks to months).</p>
<h2 id=when-did-the-volcano-in-st-lucia-erupt>When did the volcano in St Lucia erupt?</h2>
<p>The Caribbean island of St. Vincent is facing a series of eruptions from the La Soufriere volcano, which killed 1,600 people when it erupted in 1902.</p>
<h2 id=does-saint-lucia-have-a-volcano>Does Saint Lucia have a volcano?</h2>
<p>Like many other Caribbean islands, St. Lucia is of volcanic origin. The island is still volcanically active.</p>
<h2 id=is-saint-lucia-volcano-active>Is Saint Lucia volcano active?</h2>
<p>The Soufrière Volcanic Centre (SVC) is the only ‘live’ (likely to erupt again) volcano in Saint Lucia. It is made up of a series of volcanic vents- which we see as mountains and craters – near the town of Soufrière in the southe-western region of the island.</p>
<h2 id=is-st-lucia-volcano-still-active>Is St Lucia volcano still active?</h2>
<p>The Pitons are a remnant of a heavy volcanic eruption thousands of years ago. Like many other Caribbean islands, St. Lucia is of volcanic origin. The island is still volcanically active.</p>

<h2 id=is-st-lucia-covered-in-ash>Is St Lucia covered in ash?</h2>
<p>Ash plumes and sulphur dioxide reached far enough away to affect Barbados, Grenada, and Saint Lucia. The falling ash has also impacted St Lucia, especially affecting residents in the south of the island.</p>
<h2 id=is-la-soufriere-a-super-volcano>Is La Soufriere a super volcano?</h2>
<p>Geography and structure At 1,234 m (4,049 ft), La Soufrière is the highest peak on Saint Vincent as well as the highest point in Saint Vincent and the Grenadines. Soufrière is a stratovolcano with a crater lake and is the island’s youngest and northernmost volcano.</p>

<p>Also, the only active submarine volcano in the Eastern Caribbean is the Kick ’em Jenny volcano, located just 6.2 miles north of Grenada….Active Volcanoes in the Eastern Caribbean.</p>
