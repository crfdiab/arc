<p>Using the skills they had honed battling American Indians in Texas, the Rangers quickly made a name for themselves as bold fighters during the U.S.-Mexican War (1846-48). Their scouting and tracking skills also helped locate Mexican camps and guerilla fighters both during and after the war.</p>

<p>Over the years, the Texas Rangers have investigated crimes ranging from murder to political corruption, acted in riot control and as detectives, protected the governor of Texas, tracked down fugitives, and functioned as a paramilitary force at the service of both the Republic (1836–1845) and the state of Texas.</p>

<h2 id=do-texas-rangers-really-wear-cowboy-hats>Do Texas Rangers really wear cowboy hats?</h2>
<p>To be dressed appropriately, Rangers are required to wear a western hat, a dress shirt, a tie, a dress coat, appropriate pants, western belt, western boots, and the official Texas Ranger badge pinned above the left shirt pocket. All clothing will be clean, neat, and with a pressed appearance.</p>
<h2 id=what-did-the-texas-rangers-do-to-mexicans>What did the Texas Rangers do to Mexicans?</h2>
<p>The Texas Rangers became so notorious for their brutality against Mexicans and Mexican Americans they were dubbed ‘los diablos tejanos’ which means ‘the Texan devils.’ ‘I’m at a loss!’ Baffled Democratic Dayton mayor says she… America divided: Pro and anti-Trump protesters greet the…</p>
<h2 id=who-was-killed-by-the-texas-rangers-in-texas>Who was killed by the Texas Rangers in Texas?</h2>
<p>The Texas Rangers killed Serda, no questions asked. Gonzales’s family was one of many affected by some of the worst state-sanctioned violence in the history of the U.S. Today, he’s part of a group of scholars working to get this part of Texas history recognized.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-the-texas-rangers-lead-to-the-bandit-war>How did the Texas Rangers lead to the Bandit War?</h2>
<p>But the influx of refugees led to violent scuffles on the border and led to the Bandit War, a series of raids in Texas from 1915 to 1919 carried out by Mexican rebels from the states of Tamaulipas, Coahuila, and Chihuahua that led to Anglo-Texan counter-raids.</p>
<h2 id=what-did-the-texas-ranger-division-do-in-1848>What did the Texas Ranger Division do in 1848?</h2>
<p>As the Victoria Advocate reported in the November 16, 1848, issue: Four newly raised ranging companies, have all been organized, and taken their several stations on our frontier. We are much pleased. We know they are true men, and they know exactly what they are about. With many of them Indian and Mexican fighting has been their trade for years.</p>
