<h2 id=how-clean-is-the-providence-river>How clean is the Providence River?</h2>
<p>This spring the Rhode Island Department of Environmental Management (DEM) opened the lower third of the Providence River to quahogging on a conditional basis for the first time in more than 75 years. And experts say the river is clean enough to fish, too.</p>
<h2 id=is-providence-river-freshwater>Is Providence River freshwater?</h2>
<p>Narragansett Bay is divided by Conanicut Island into east and west passages. Water from these freshwater inputs mixes with sea water to form a salinity gradient ranging from 24 ppt at the mouth of the Providence River to 32 ppt at the mouth of the bay. Water temperatures range between -0.5 °C and 24 °C over the year.</p>
<h2 id=how-deep-is-the-providence-river>How deep is the Providence River?</h2>
<p>Abreast the lower end of Warren the channel is about 0.1 mile wide, with depths of 13 to 17 feet in midchannel, and small vessels can anchor temporarily at this point. Providence is at the head of navigation on the Providence River, about 7 miles above the entrance, at the junction of the Providence and Seekonk Rivers.</p>
<h2 id=how-long-is-the-providence-river>How long is the Providence River?</h2>
<p>13 km<br>
Providence River/Length</p>
<h2 id=can-you-swim-in-the-seekonk-river>Can you swim in the Seekonk River?</h2>
<p>Swimming in the Seekonk River, which doesn’t have any licensed beaches, and eating fish caught in it aren’t recommended because of this toxic legacy and because of the continued, although declining, presence of pathogens, such as fecal coliform and enterococci.</p>
<h2 id=where-is-the-new-providence-pedestrian-bridge>Where is the New Providence pedestrian bridge?</h2>
<p>US architecture firm Inform Studio and Buro Happold have designed a curved and stepped wood-covered pedestrian bridge to link two parks in Providence, Rhode Island. Spanning 394 feet (120 metres), the Providence River Pedestrian Bridge connects new green spaces on the east and west sides of the city’s riverfront.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-largest-river-in-rhode-island>What is the largest river in Rhode Island?</h2>
<p>Blackstone River<br>
Blackstone River is the longest river in the state of Rhode Island.</p>
<h2 id=are-there-any-rivers-in-rhode-island>Are there any rivers in Rhode Island?</h2>
<p>Most of Rhode Island’s streams, ponds, and lakes drain into three major rivers: the Blackstone, the Pawtuxet, and the Pawcatuck. The Blackstone and Pawtuxet Rivers flow into Narragansett Bay, while the Pawcatuck River flows into Little Narragansett Bay and then on to the Atlantic Ocean.</p>
<h2 id=where-does-the-providence-river-end>Where does the Providence River End?</h2>
<p>Narragansett Bay<br>
Providence River/Mouths</p>
<h2 id=is-it-safe-to-swim-in-narragansett-bay>Is it safe to swim in Narragansett Bay?</h2>
<p>Test results of the Little Narragansett Bay watershed from the University of Rhode Island’s Watershed Watch water-quality monitoring program showed that in several locations, it was unsafe to swim.</p>
<h2 id=is-the-seekonk-river-polluted>Is the Seekonk River polluted?</h2>
<p>Pollutants degrading water quality in the river include heavy metals, oil and gas, untreated sewage, trash, and nitrogen leached from nearby soils. While some of these pollutants arise from within the Seekonk River corridor, upstream pollution also contributes to the river’s degraded water quality.</p>
<h2 id=how-long-is-the-providence-river-in-rhode-island>How long is the Providence River in Rhode Island?</h2>
<p>The Providence River is a tidal river in the U.S. state of Rhode Island. It flows approximately 8 miles (13 km).</p>
<h2 id=where-does-the-water-fire-take-place-in-providence>Where does the water fire take place in Providence?</h2>
<p>On WaterFire evenings, downtown Providence is transformed by eighty-six anchored burning braziers (each with approximately 33 pieces of wood) that float just above the surface of the rivers that flow through Waterplace Park (the Woonasquatucket river) and the middle of downtown Providence (the Moshassuck and Providence rivers).</p>
<h2 id=are-there-any-dams-on-the-providence-river>Are there any dams on the Providence River?</h2>
<p>There are no dams along the river’s length, although the Fox Point Hurricane Barrier is located south of downtown to protect the city of Providence from damaging tidal floods. The southern part of the river has been dredged at a cost of $65 million in federal and state funds to benefit nearby marinas and commercial shipping interests.</p>
<h2 id=where-is-the-entrance-to-the-providence-river>Where is the entrance to the Providence River?</h2>
<p>At the narrows between Conimicut Point, in Warwick to the west and Nayatt Point in Barrington to the east, the Conimicut Shoal Lighthouse marks the entrance to the river from Narragansett Bay . Since the late 1990s, the Providence River has been known for Gondola rides, which can be enjoyed by tourists and locals daily in season.</p>
