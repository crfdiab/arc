<h2 id=does-maine-have-a-state-fish>Does Maine have a state fish?</h2>
<p>State Fish – Landlocked Salmon | Maine Secretary of State Kids’ Page.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-landlocked-salmon-called>What are landlocked salmon called?</h2>
<p>Salmo salar<br>
a variety of the Atlantic Ocean salmon, Salmo salar, confined to the freshwater lakes of New England and adjacent areas of Canada. Also called lake salmon.</p>
<h2 id=is-landlocked-salmon-good-to-eat>Is landlocked salmon good to eat?</h2>
<p>How to Cook and Eat Landlocked Salmon Though these fish are smaller and not as rich and fatty as true anadromous salmon, they are still delicious. With a light and slightly oily flesh, they’ll work well with any of your favorite trout or salmon recipes.</p>
<h2 id=how-long-do-landlocked-salmon-live>How long do landlocked salmon live?</h2>
<p>Most salmon species live 2 to 7 years (4 to 5 average). Steelhead trout can live up to about 11 years.</p>
<h2 id=are-kokanee-and-sockeye-the-same>Are Kokanee and sockeye the same?</h2>
<p>The only difference physically is their size. Kokanee Salmon are very much smaller than Sockeye, which can make them harder to distinguish. Usually, a small Sockeye is just called a Kokanee, and it’s pretty accurate.</p>
<h2 id=why-do-salmon-jump-out-of-the-water>Why do salmon jump out of the water?</h2>
<p>The reason, according to a new study, is that they’re infested with sea lice—and are trying to splash them off. It takes an average of 56 leaps to dislodge a single sea louse, during which time the fish could be easy prey for predators like seabirds. The effort also drains energy the salmon need for other things.</p>
<h2 id=what-kind-of-fish-do-they-catch-in-maine>What kind of fish do they catch in Maine?</h2>
<p>Freshwater Fishing. Maine’s thousands of miles of rivers and streams, and hundreds of freshwater lakes, are still thriving today. Fishermen can chase brook trout, rainbow trout, brown trout, lake trout, landlocked salmon, smallmouth bass, largemouth bass, pike and musky.</p>
<h2 id=where-can-i-find-nonnative-fish-in-maine>Where can I find nonnative fish in Maine?</h2>
<p>Nonnative muskellunge have all but eliminated native brook from the St. John River, nonnative Pike can now be found in Sebago Lake and throughout the Belgrade Lakes, and invasive smallmouth bass have established self-sustaining populations throughout the Kennebec, Dead, Rapid, Penobscot, and Dennys Rivers, as well as many other lakes and rivers.</p>
<h2 id=do-you-need-a-fishing-license-in-maine>Do you need a fishing license in Maine?</h2>
<p>The fish are hungry, but first things first: you need a Maine fishing license. Get your license from the Maine Department of Inland Fisheries & Wildlife, and be sure to review the fishing laws before you cast a line.</p>
<h2 id=what-kind-of-scales-does-a-maine-fish-have>What kind of scales does a Maine Fish have?</h2>
<p>Scales of Maine fish may be divided into the cycloid type and the ctenoid type. Cycloid scales are usually small, and embedded deeply in the skin. Trout and salmon are examples of fish with cycloid scales Ctenoid scales have several rows of spines along their posterior, or exposed edge.</p>
