<h2 id=what-states-are-listed-on-the-five-dollar-bill>What states are listed on the five dollar bill?</h2>
<p>Solution to the Mystery of the Hidden States Forty-eight states are carved into the actual Lincoln Memorial, but we can only see one side of the building on a five dollar bill. Lower course: Delaware, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Georgia, Connecticut, Massachusetts, Maryland, Carolina, Hampshire, Virginia, New York.</p>
<h2 id=is-there-a-rare-5-dollar-bill>Is there a rare 5 dollar bill?</h2>
<p>The first year the Federal Reserve Bank of United States printed $5 bills was in 1862. These $5 bills were called large size legal tender bills, and today they can be very valuable if their condition is good. In rare instances, we’ve paid over $40,000 for unique national bank note $5 bills. It definitely does happen.</p>
<h2 id=when-did-the-5-dollar-bill-become-legal-tender>When did the 5 dollar bill become legal tender?</h2>
<p>1963: Both the $5 United States Note and Federal Reserve Note were revised with the motto IN GOD WE TRUST added to the reverse and WILL PAY TO THE BEARER ON DEMAND removed from the obverse. Also, the obligation on the Federal Reserve Note was shortened to its current wording, THIS NOTE IS LEGAL TENDER FOR ALL DEBTS PUBLIC AND PRIVATE.</p>
<h2 id=where-are-the-26-states-on-the-5-dollar-bill>Where are the 26 states on the 5 dollar bill?</h2>
<p>These are the 26 states that can be seen on the front side of the Lincoln memorial which is what is pictured on the $5 bill. On the back of the bill, a larger, purple numeral “5” appears in the lower right corner to help those with visual impairments to distinguish the denomination.</p>
<h2 id=when-did-the-first-5-dollar-bill-come-out>When did the first 5 dollar bill come out?</h2>
<p>Grant was featured on a coin instead of a bill. The first $5 bill in the U.S. that featured Lincoln was released in 1914. He appeared on the red seal addition of the bill during this year, but also made an appearance on bills in 1915 and 1918.</p>
<h2 id=whats-the-difference-between-the-old-and-new-5-dollar-bills>What’s the difference between the old and new 5 dollar bills?</h2>
<p>Design features. The new $5 bills remain the same size and use the same—but enhanced—portraits and historical images. The most noticeable difference is the light-purple coloring of the center of the bill, which blends into gray near the edges.</p>
