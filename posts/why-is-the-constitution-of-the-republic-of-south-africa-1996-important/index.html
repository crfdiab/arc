<h2 id=why-is-the-constitution-of-the-republic-of-south-africa-1996-important>Why is the Constitution of the Republic of South Africa 1996 important?</h2>
<p>Parliament passed the Constitution in 1996. The Constitution contains the most important rules of our political system. It protects the rights of the people inside the country, and it explains their obligations. It defines the institutions of South Africa, what their powers are, and how they may use their powers.</p>
<h2 id=is-the-constitution-of-south-africa-an-act>Is the Constitution of South Africa an act?</h2>
<p>The Constitution is formally entitled the “Constitution of the Republic of South Africa, 1996.” It was previously also numbered as if it were an Act of Parliament—Act No….Constitution of South Africa.</p>
<table><tr><th>Constitution of the Republic of South Africa, 1996</th></tr><tr><td>Branches</td><td>Three (executive, legislature and judiciary)</td></tr><tr><td>Chambers</td><td>Bicameral (Parliament)</td></tr></table>
<h2 id=what-is-the-constitution-of-south-africa>What is the constitution of South Africa?</h2>
<p>The Constitution of the Republic of South Africa, 1996, was approved by the Constitutional Court (CC) on 4 December 1996 and took effect on 4 February 1997. The Constitution is the supreme law of the land. No other law or government action can supersede the provisions of the Constitution.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-purpose-of-section-36-of-the-constitution>What is the purpose of Section 36 of the Constitution?</h2>
<p>Section 36 requires that the weighing must have a specified substantive outcome, namely an outcome that is justifiable in an open and democratic society based on human dignity, equality and freedom, and not in a closed, authoritarian society based on the violation of human dignity, equality and freedom.</p>
<h2 id=why-the-bill-of-rights-is-important-for-south-africa-give-4-reasons>Why the Bill of rights is important for South Africa give 4 reasons?</h2>
<p>(1) This Bill of Rights is a cornerstone of democracy in South Africa. It enshrines the rights of all people in our country and affirms the democratic values of human dignity, equality and freedom. (2) The state must respect, protect, promote and fulfil the rights in the Bill of Rights.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-the-three-main-points-of-the-constitution>What are the three main points of the Constitution?</h2>
<p>The Constitution has three main functions. First it creates a national government consisting of a legislative, an executive, and a judicial branch, with a system of checks and balances among the three branches. Second, it divides power between the federal government and the states.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-the-main-points-of-the-constitution>What are the main points of the Constitution?</h2>
<p>The Six Big Ideas are:</p>
<ul>
<li>limited government.</li>
<li>republicanism.</li>
<li>checks and balances.</li>
<li>federalism.</li>
<li>separation of powers.</li>
<li>popular sovereignty.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id=what-rights-do-south-african-citizens-have>What rights do South African citizens have?</h2>
<p>Rights</p>
<ul>
<li>Equality.</li>
<li>Human dignity.</li>
<li>Life.</li>
<li>Freedom and security of the person.</li>
<li>Slavery, servitude and forced labour.</li>
<li>Privacy.</li>
<li>Freedom of religion, belief and opinion.</li>
<li>Freedom of expression.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id=do-constitutional-rights-have-limits>Do constitutional rights have limits?</h2>
<p>Some limits on constitutional rights are well established. Because such an act would result in such danger to the public that preventing that danger overrides an individual’s right to that speech. In other words, the government has “a compelling state interest” in preventing this kind of speech.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-the-five-factors-that-should-be-considered-when-applying-section-36-of-the-constitution>What are the five factors that should be considered when applying section 36 of the Constitution?</h2>
<p>Section 36 of the Constitution further specifically provides that when limiting rights all relevant factors must be taken into account, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>The nature of the right;</li>
<li>The importance of the purpose of the limitation;</li>
<li>The nature and extent of the limitation;</li>
<li>The relation between the limitation and its purpose; and.</li>
</ul>
