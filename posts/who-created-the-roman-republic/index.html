<h2 id=who-created-the-roman-republic>Who created the Roman Republic?</h2>
<p>It all began when the Romans overthrew their Etruscan conquerors in 509 B.C.E. Centered north of Rome, the Etruscans had ruled over the Romans for hundreds of years. Once free, the Romans established a republic, a government in which citizens elected representatives to rule on their behalf.</p>
<h2 id=when-did-rome-cease-to-be-a-republic>When did Rome cease to be a republic?</h2>
<p>Roman Republic, (509–27 bce), the ancient state centred on the city of Rome that began in 509 bce, when the Romans replaced their monarchy with elected magistrates, and lasted until 27 bce, when the Roman Empire was established.</p>
<h2 id=what-did-roman-senators-do>What did Roman senators do?</h2>
<p>The senate of the Roman Kingdom held three principal responsibilities: It functioned as the ultimate repository for the executive power, it served as the king’s council, and it functioned as a legislative body in concert with the people of Rome.</p>
<h2 id=why-was-the-roman-senate-so-powerful>Why was the Roman Senate so powerful?</h2>
<p>In the early ages of Rome, the senate was there to advise the king. During the Roman Republic the senate became more powerful. The senate also controlled the spending of the state money, making it very powerful. Later, during the Roman Empire, the senate had less power and the real power was held by the emperor.</p>
<h2 id=who-is-the-head-of-government-in-romania>Who is the head of government in Romania?</h2>
<p>Romania’s political framework is a semi-presidential representative democratic republic where the Prime Minister is the head of government and the President is the head of state. Executive power is exercised by the President of the republic and the government.</p>
<h2 id=who-was-the-leader-of-romania-in-1968>Who was the leader of Romania in 1968?</h2>
<p>Despite his country’s membership in the Warsaw Pact, Ceaușescu recognised the state of Israel, supported Romanian nationalism, and denounced the 1968 Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia. With his 1971 July Theses speech, Ceaușescu launched a quasi- Maoist and Neo-Stalinist reform.</p>
<h2 id=what-kind-of-government-did-romania-have-from-1948-to-1989>What kind of government did Romania have from 1948 to 1989?</h2>
<p>From 1948 until 1989, the communist rule political structure took place in the framework of a one-party socialist republic governed by the Romanian Communist Party (PCR) as its only legal party. Romania’s 1991 constitution (amended in 2003) proclaims it a democratic and social republic, deriving its sovereignty from the people.</p>
<h2 id=what-kind-of-parliament-is-there-in-romania>What kind of Parliament is there in Romania?</h2>
<p>The national legislature is a bicameral parliament (Romanian: Parlament), consisting of the Chamber of Deputies (Camera Deputaților) and the Senate (Senat).</p>
