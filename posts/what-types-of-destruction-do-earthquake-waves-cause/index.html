<h2 id=what-types-of-destruction-do-earthquake-waves-cause>What types of destruction do earthquake waves cause?</h2>
<p>The damage caused by earthquakes is from ground shaking, ground rupture, landslides, tsunamis, and liquefaction. Earthquake damage from fires is the most important secondary effect.</p>
<h2 id=which-are-four-factors-that-affect-the-amount-of-destruction-caused-by-earthquake-vibrations>Which are four factors that affect the amount of destruction caused by earthquake vibrations?</h2>
<p>Ground shaking is the primary cause of earthquake damage to man-made structures. Many factors influence the strength of earthquake shaking at a site including the earthquake’s magnitude, the site’s proximity to the fault, the local geology, and the soil type.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-some-destructive-or-negative-effects-of-earthquakes>What are some destructive or negative effects of earthquakes?</h2>
<p>Some of the common impacts of earthquakes include structural damage to buildings, fires, damage to bridges and highways, initiation of slope failures, liquefaction, and tsunami.</p>
<h2 id=what-do-earthquake-vibrations-cause>What do earthquake vibrations cause?</h2>
<p>The two general types of vibrations produced by earthquakes are surface waves, which travel along the Earth’s surface, and body waves, which travel through the Earth. Surface waves usually have the strongest vibrations and probably cause most of the damage done by earthquakes.</p>
<h2 id=what-causes-buildings-to-vibrate-during-an-earthquake>What causes buildings to vibrate during an earthquake?</h2>
<p>Buildings vibrate as a consequence of the ground shaking; damage takes place if the building cannot withstand these vibrations. Compressional waves and shear waves mainly cause high-frequency (greater than 1 Hertz) vibrations which are more efficient than low-frequency waves in causing low buildings to vibrate.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-some-of-the-effects-of-an-earthquake>What are some of the effects of an earthquake?</h2>
<p>What are the Effects of Earthquakes? What are the Effects of Earthquakes? The effects from earthquakes include ground shaking, surface faulting, ground failure, and less commonly, tsunamis. Ground shaking is a term used to describe the vibration of the ground during an earthquake.</p>
<h2 id=what-causes-the-ground-to-shake-during-an-earthquake>What causes the ground to shake during an earthquake?</h2>
<p>Ground shaking is caused by body waves and surface waves. As a generalization, the severity of ground shaking increases as magnitude increases and decreases as distance from the causative fault increases.</p>
<h2 id=what-kind-of-vibrations-can-cause-damage-to-a-building>What kind of vibrations can cause damage to a building?</h2>
<p>Vibrations from railways, heavy transport, construction work and industrial and military activities are not generally powerful enough to cause damage to buildings, but are a nuisance to many people and may disturb precision instruments. Vibrations from railways, heavy transport, construction work etc. are a nuisance to many people.</p>
