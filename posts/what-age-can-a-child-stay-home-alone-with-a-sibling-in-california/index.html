<p>At this moment, the State of California doesn’t have any actual laws that deal how old your child has to be before you can leave them unattended while you run to the store. The only states that currently have such laws are Maryland, Illinois, and Oregon. The states that do have laws have set that age from 10-12.</p>
<h2 id=can-a-14-year-old-babysit-siblings-in-california>Can a 14 year old babysit siblings in California?</h2>
