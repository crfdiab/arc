<h2 id=how-long-does-it-take-for-a-fiance-visa-to-be-approved>How long does it take for a fiance visa to be approved?</h2>
<p>It takes 8-10 months on average (as of June 2021) for U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) to process Form I-129F (technically called the “Petition for Alien Fiancé”), and an additional 4-6 weeks processing time for the agency to send an interview request at the nearest U.S. embassy or consulate.</p>
<h2 id=can-you-get-a-fiance-visa-with-a-criminal-record>Can you get a fiance visa with a criminal record?</h2>
<p>If your foreign fiancé(e) has an arrest, conviction, or other criminal record, the U.S. government may deny the K-1 visa. If you want to bring a fiancé(e) into the U.S. on a K-1 visa to get married and to apply for a green card, and your fiance has a criminal record, that fact is likely to trigger inadmissibility.</p>

<h2 id=how-often-do-k1-visas-get-denied>How often do K1 visas get denied?</h2>
<p>According to those statistics, approximately 20,000 K-1 fiancées/fiancés every year are denied visas when they go to their interviews at the embassy. This is nearly 40% of the total number of K-1 visa applicants. And while eventually many of them are able to overcome the initial denial, some do not.</p>
