<p>Some consider kushari, a mixture of rice, lentils, and macaroni, to be the national dish. Ful medames is also one of the most popular dishes. Fava bean is also used in making falafel (most commonly referred to as ta’ameya in Egypt, and served with fresh tomatoes, tahina sauce and arugula).</p>

<p>koshari<br>
Iconic. Beloved. Also spelled koshari or kushari (those pesky transliterations from Arabic script!), it is widely considered Egypt’s national dish. Rice, lentils (black or brown), chickpeas and pasta are cooked individually, then tossed together and topped with cumin-scented tomato sauce and crunchy fried onions.</p>
<h2 id=what-kind-of-food-do-people-in-egypt-eat>What kind of food do people in Egypt eat?</h2>
<p>Habits & Customs Egyptians eat a standard three meals a day. For most people breakfast consists of bread and cheese, maybe olives or a fried egg at home, or a fuul (fava bean paste) sandwich on the run to work.</p>
<h2 id=what-kind-of-beans-are-eaten-in-egypt>What kind of beans are eaten in Egypt?</h2>
<p>Ful, pronounced as fool, is made of fava beans cooked with oil and salt. Fava beans (broad beans) are encased in long fat green pods. They require soaking overnight and cooking for hours over low heat in an “idra” in order to remove the beans casing.</p>
<h2 id=what-kind-of-falafel-do-they-eat-in-egypt>What kind of falafel do they eat in Egypt?</h2>
<p>The ta’meya, or Egyptian falafel is made out of crushed fava beans that is later mixed and made into a paste then fried, unlike Lebanese falafel that is made out of hummus. Perfect for vegetarians. Left: Ful by Noema Pérez, Flickr. Right: Ta’meya – Falafel – by ~W~, Flickr. 2. Kushari:</p>
<h2 id=what-kind-of-bread-did-the-ancient-egyptians-eat>What kind of bread did the ancient Egyptians eat?</h2>
<p>Egyptian bread is a flatbread, called aysh, similar to pita bread. Most Egyptians eat with their hands, using small pieces of bread to scoop up their food. Egyptians always serve themselves with their right hands, as the left hand is considered unclean, and to use the left hand would pollute the communal dish.</p>
