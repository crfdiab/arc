<p>Canada remained a French territory until 1763 when it became the British colony of the Province of Quebec….Canada (New France)</p>

<h2 id=did-the-french-lose-control-of-canada>Did the French lose control of Canada?</h2>
<p>With the Treaty of Paris of 1763, France formally ceded Canada to the British. In 1758, the tide turned when the British captured Louisbourg, followed by Quebec City in 1759 and Montreal in 1760. With the Treaty of Paris of 1763, France formally ceded Canada to the British.</p>

<p>In 1754, England and France began to duke it out in Canada itself. France allied itself with Aboriginal Canadians to boost its small troop numbers, but it was no match for British forces. By 1759, the British had roundly defeated the French and the French and Indian War (part of the broader conflict called the Seven Years War) ended soon after.</p>
<h2 id=what-did-france-give-up-for-the-colony-of-canada>What did France give up for the colony of Canada?</h2>
<p>As part of the treaty, France formally renounced its claims to all its North American lands to Britain (of which the French colony of Canada was a part), except Louisiana (which had been instead ceded to Spain), and two islands off the shores of Newfoundland ( Saint-Pierre and Miquelon ).</p>
