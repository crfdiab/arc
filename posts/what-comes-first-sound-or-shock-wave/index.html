<h2 id=what-comes-first-sound-or-shock-wave>What comes first sound or shock wave?</h2>
<p>In particular, shock waves travel faster than sound, and their speed increases as the amplitude is raised; but the intensity of a shock wave also decreases faster than does that of a sound wave, because some of the energy of the shock wave is expended to heat the medium in which it travels.</p>
<h2 id=at-what-point-does-sound-become-a-shockwave>At what point does sound become a shockwave?</h2>
<p>When the speed of a source exceeds the speed of sound (v > c) the wave fronts lag behind the source in a cone-shaped region with the source at the vertex. The edge of the cone forms a supersonic wave front with an unusually large amplitude called a “shock wave”.</p>
<h2 id=under-what-conditions-do-shock-waves-occur>Under what conditions do shock waves occur?</h2>
<p>Shock waves are narrow regions of air where pressure, temperature, and density characteristics are drastically different than surrounding areas. Shock waves occur when objects move faster than the speed of sound, which is 1,236 kilometers (768 miles) per hour.</p>
<h2 id=why-the-first-shock-wave-is-formed-on-the-wing-upper-surface>Why the first shock wave is formed on the wing upper surface?</h2>
<p>When the wing is tilted upward, a shock wave forms below its leading edge, and an expansion wave forms above its leading edge. The higher pressure behind the shock wave and lower pressure behind the expansion wave result in a single force that pushes the wing up and back.</p>
<h2 id=how-much-force-does-it-take-to-create-a-shockwave>How much force does it take to create a shockwave?</h2>
<p>shockwaves depend on target is proportional to force =small force =small shockwaves,bigf=bsw so shockwaves always egzist be impact force it just can be very small for egzample 0,1Gforce on object weight 5kg mean peak force was around 0,5kgf or 5 newtons or huge like 1000gforce from impact the same 5kg object=around …</p>
<h2 id=how-fast-is-a-shock-wave>How fast is a shock wave?</h2>
<p>Close to an explosion, a shock wave can travel at several times the speed of sound and reach pressures of ten or more atmospheres, producing devastating effects. Also, the “wind” that immediately follows a strong shock wave is brief but very intense.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-normal-shock-wave>What is normal shock wave?</h2>
<p>Shock waves are very small regions in the gas where the gas properties change by a large amount. Across a shock wave, the static pressure, temperature, and gas density increases almost instantaneously. If the shock wave is perpendicular to the flow direction it is called a normal shock.</p>
<h2 id=how-do-you-survive-a-shock-wave>How do you survive a shock wave?</h2>
<ol>
<li>It depends on location, type, force and proximity to the shockwave.</li>
<li>Look at it like this.</li>
<li>By emptying your lungs as much as possible you give room for your lungs to expand without popping.</li>
<li>If you think you might be in an area where a shock wave is coming try to avoid being in that area.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id=what-do-you-do-if-you-see-a-shock-wave>What do you do if you see a shock wave?</h2>
<p>If you are outside, get aways from anything that may move, and put anything you can between you and the blast. Then lay face down with your feet pointed towards the blast. Ideally jump into a ditch. Stay down for longer than just the pressure wave traveling over you.</p>
<h2 id=when-do-shock-waves-exceed-the-speed-of-sound>When do shock waves exceed the speed of sound?</h2>
<p>When the speed of a source exceeds the speed of sound (v > c) the wave fronts lag behind the source in a cone-shaped region with the source at the vertex. The edge of the cone forms a supersonic wave front with an unusually large amplitude called a “shock wave”. When a shock wave reaches an observer a “sonic boom” is heard.</p>
<h2 id=how-does-a-shock-wave-form-on-a-wing>How does a shock wave form on a wing?</h2>
<p>The shock wave that formed on the wing is now at the trailing edge. When the wing is tilted upward, a shock wave forms below its leading edge, and an expansion wave forms above its leading edge. The higher pressure behind the shock wave and lower pressure behind the expansion wave result in a single force that pushes the wing up and back.</p>
<h2 id=can-a-shock-wave-be-formed-in-space>Can a shock wave be formed in space?</h2>
<p>A ‘shock wave’ is the disturbance of material that’s created when a wave moves through a medium at greater than the local speed of sound. Provided there is a ‘medium’ of sufficient density through which a shock wave can travel, there is no reason why shock waves can’t form in space.</p>
<h2 id=why-is-a-shock-wave-called-an-oblique-shock>Why is a shock wave called an oblique shock?</h2>
<p>The ratio of the total pressure is shown on the slide. Because total pressure changes across the shock, we can not use the usual (incompressible) form of Bernoulli’s equation across the shock. The Mach number and speed of the flow also decrease across a shock wave. If the shock wave is inclined to the flow direction it is called an oblique shock.</p>
