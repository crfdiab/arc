<h2 id=what-should-you-do-if-you-are-outside-during-a-tornado>What should you do if you are outside during a tornado?</h2>
<p>If you’re outside when a tornado approaches, find shelter quickly. If there is no shelter nearby, go to a low-lying area such as a ditch or ravine and lie flat. Protect your head and neck with an object or with your arms. Avoid areas with many trees.</p>
<h2 id=do-you-open-windows-during-a-tornado>Do you open windows during a tornado?</h2>
<p>You should open your windows during a tornado. Always seek out shelter in the southwest corner of any building. Some tornadoes have changed direction amid path, or even backtracked.</p>
<h2 id=what-happens-if-you-open-your-windows-during-a-tornado>What happens if you open your windows during a tornado?</h2>
<p>According to the experts, opening the windows will only succeed in letting the winds into the house so that internal supports can be shaken apart which will weaken the house even more. The bottom line is – don’t open your windows. It’s a waste of time! Try to outrun a tornado.</p>
<h2 id=where-do-you-go-during-a-tornado-in-an-upstairs-apartment>Where do you go during a tornado in an upstairs apartment?</h2>
<p>Interior rooms Under a stairwell, an interior hallway or even a room within your apartment can work. Make sure there are no windows. Crouch down as low as you can get with your face down. Cover your head with your hands for extra protection or bring in a bike helmet to wear during the storm.</p>
<h2 id=what-should-you-do-if-you-are-at-home-when-a-tornado-occurs>What should you do if you are at home when a tornado occurs?</h2>
<p>The best place to shelter during a tornado is in a basement or storm cellar. If such a space is not available, staying indoors in the center of a building is a good solution. People in cars, trailer homes, tents, and other unstable structures should exit and find a solid building to shelter in.</p>
<h2 id=what-should-you-do-when-you-see-a-tornado>What should you do when you see a tornado?</h2>
<p>If you can see the tornado in the distance, NOAA recommends changing course and driving toward a sturdy shelter as soon as you are able. They recommend truck stops, convenience stores, restaurants, and even walk-in coolers. Once you are inside, go to the basement, a cellar, or a hallway or room without windows in the center of the house.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-the-safety-procedures-for-a-tornado>What are the safety procedures for a tornado?</h2>
<p>Specific tornado safety procedures vary from location to location, building to building, at the University, however, general safety precautions include: Taking shelter in the nearest substantial building immediately. Going to the basement or to an interior corridor. Avoiding windows, large rooms, auditoriums or gymnasiums.</p>
