<p>“He said, ‘I am just going outside and may be some time. ‘ He went out into the blizzard and we have not seen him since,” Scott wrote on March 16. On Thursday, March 29, Scott recorded his final entry: “We had fuel to make two cups of tea apiece and bare food for two days on the 20th.</p>
<h2 id=what-did-captain-scott-say>What did Captain Scott say?</h2>
<p>In a final remark in his letter, he writes: “We have got to within 11 miles of our depot with one hot meal and two days’ cold food and we should have got through but have been held for four days by a frightful storm. I think our best chance has gone.</p>
<h2 id=what-did-scott-first-see-when-he-reached-the-south-pole>What did Scott first see when he reached the South Pole?</h2>
<p>On the first expedition, he set a new southern record by marching to latitude 82°S and discovered the Antarctic Plateau, on which the South Pole is located.</p>
<h2 id=why-did-sir-walter-scott-want-to-go-to-antarctica>Why did Sir Walter Scott want to go to Antarctica?</h2>
<p>Aware of how close Shackleton had come to snatching what he regarded as his trophy, Scott planned his British Antarctic Expedition 1910–13 meticulously. It was to be the pinnacle of Edwardian exploration with the attainment of the Geographical South Pole for Britain being the ultimate goal.</p>
<h2 id=when-was-robert-falcon-scotts-second-expedition-to-antarctica>When was Robert Falcon Scott’s second expedition to Antarctica?</h2>
<p>No products in the cart. When Captain Robert Falcon Scott embarked on his second and last expedition in 1910 he was already a famous Antarctic explorer. He had previously led the major National Antarctic Expedition (1901–04) during which he reached a record 82º11’ South, and a great many scientific and geographical discoveries were made.</p>
<h2 id=when-did-captain-robert-scott-go-to-the-south-pole>When did Captain Robert Scott go to the South Pole?</h2>
<p>Captain Robert Scott’s ill-fated expedition to the South Pole took place 95 years ago. To mark the occasion, Cambridge University is putting some of his last correspondence on display for the first time.</p>
<h2 id=when-did-sir-ernest-shackleton-turn-back-from-antarctica>When did Sir Ernest Shackleton turn back from Antarctica?</h2>
<p>Just 18 months before Scott’s second expedition departed, Shackleton had turned back only 97 miles south of the Pole. Aware of how close Shackleton had come to snatching what he regarded as his trophy, Scott planned his British Antarctic Expedition 1910–13 meticulously.</p>
