<h2 id=what-happened-to-the-cro-magnons>What happened to the Cro-Magnons?</h2>
<p>The rock shelters were used year-round; the Cro-Magnons seem to have been a settled people, moving only when necessary to find new hunting or because of environmental changes. Like the Neanderthals, the Cro-Magnon people buried their dead. Some of the first examples of art by prehistoric peoples are Cro-Magnon.</p>
<h2 id=how-long-did-cro-magnon-live>How long did Cro-Magnon live?</h2>
<p>Associated tools and fragments of fossil animal bone date the site to the uppermost Pleistocene, probably between 32,000 and 30,000 years old. Cro-Magnon 1 is a middle-aged, male skeleton of one of the four adults found in the cave at Cro-Magnon. Scientists estimate his age at death at less than 50 years old.</p>
<h2 id=are-cro-magnons-extinct>Are Cro-Magnons extinct?</h2>
<p>In the form of a common insult, their legacy lives on today, and perhaps more accurately than we think: new research suggests that the Neanderthal’s extinction was not due to climate change (as was previously argued) but rather to their inability to beat the competition, which came in the form of Cro-Magnon—the first …</p>
<h2 id=why-are-cro-magnons-extinct>Why are Cro-Magnons extinct?</h2>
<p>Cro-Magnon Man was smarter and generally more capable than we are. So why did he go extinct? Precisely because he was so capable. Whereas members of our species are weaklings who rely on others, members of his species had it in them to be rugged individualists; and that is what they did.</p>
<h2 id=what-do-cro-magnon-mean>What do Cro-Magnon mean?</h2>
<p>: a hominid of a tall erect race of the Upper Paleolithic known from skeletal remains found chiefly in southern France and classified as the same species (Homo sapiens) as present-day humans.</p>
<h2 id=where-did-the-cro-magnon-people-come-from>Where did the Cro Magnon people come from?</h2>
<p>Cro-Magnon. Cro-Magnon, population of early Homo sapiens dating from the Upper Paleolithic Period ( c. 40,000 to c. 10,000 years ago) in Europe. In 1868, in a shallow cave at Cro-Magnon near the town of Les Eyzies-de-Tayac in the Dordogne region of southwestern France, a number of obviously ancient human skeletons were found.</p>

<p>Like the Neanderthals, the Cro-Magnon people buried their dead. Some of the first examples of art by prehistoric peoples are Cro-Magnon. The Cro-Magnons carved and sculpted small engravings, reliefs, and statuettes not only of humans but also of animals.</p>
