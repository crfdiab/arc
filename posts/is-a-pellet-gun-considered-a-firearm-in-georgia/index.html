<h2 id=can-you-shoot-a-pellet-gun-in-your-backyard-in-georgia>Can you shoot a pellet gun in your backyard in Georgia?</h2>
<p>Registered. You can shoot your BB/Pellet gun all day long in your own backyard.</p>
<h2 id=can-you-hunt-with-an-air-rifle-in-georgia>Can you hunt with an air rifle in Georgia?</h2>
<p>Opportunities: As it states in the Georgia hunting regulations, “air gun and air rifles are legal during primitive-weapons and firearms hunting seasons. Scopes are legal on air guns. You can go hunt deer, bear, hogs and turkey, and more than likely nobody will even know you’ve shot if you do.</p>
<h2 id=can-i-own-a-fully-automatic-weapon-in-georgia>Can I own a fully automatic weapon in Georgia?</h2>
<p>The weapon is an automatic machine-gun style rifle – a rare thing among gun owners. They’re illegal in Georgia – unless the owner has a federal permit, which requires an application with a $200 fee, a photo, a background check and a signature from a local sheriff or police chief.</p>
<h2 id=can-a-felon-own-an-air-rifle-in-georgia>Can a felon own an air rifle in Georgia?</h2>
<p>The answer is probably yes. OCGA §16-11-131(a) prohibits the possession of a firearm by a felon or a first offender probationer. In that statute, “Firearm” includes any handgun, rifle, shotgun, or other weapon, which will or can be converted to expel a projectile by the action of an explosive or electrical charge.</p>
<h2 id=can-i-build-a-shooting-range-on-my-property-in-georgia>Can I build a shooting range on my property in Georgia?</h2>
<p>If you wish to shoot your guns on your own land in Georgia, and you do not have a real “shooting range” but instead just want to shoot once in a while, this is going to be legal in some places and not others, depending on the specific laws of each city, each county, how much land you own, and how far away other …</p>
<h2 id=is-it-legal-to-shoot-squirrels-in-georgia>Is it legal to shoot squirrels in Georgia?</h2>
<p>According to the Georgia Department of Natural Resources, a squirrel is considered a nuisance animal in Georgia, and it is legal for civilians to kill one. Squirrels are also considered game animals with a defined hunting season from August 15 – February 28, and with a daily bag limit of 12 per day.</p>
<h2 id=do-i-need-a-permit-to-carry-a-gun-in-my-car-in-georgia>Do I need a permit to carry a gun in my car in Georgia?</h2>
<p>– No. Georgia does not require anyone to register firearms. Do I have a to have a permit to carry a firearm in my car? – Currently, without a permit, the firearm must be carried “in the glove compartment, console, or similar compartment of the vehicle” or “in open manner and fully exposed to view”.</p>
<h2 id=can-i-carry-an-ar-15-in-my-car-in-georgia>Can I carry an AR 15 in my car in Georgia?</h2>
<p>Georgia allows anyone who is not prohibited from possessing firearms to have or carry a firearm on his or her person inside his or her motor vehicle. Georgia generally prohibits anyone from boarding or attempting to board any aircraft, bus or rail vehicle with a firearm. …</p>
<h2 id=can-anyone-buy-ammo-in-georgia>Can anyone buy ammo in Georgia?</h2>
<p>Georgia Ammo Laws There are no known unusual state-wide ammo laws in Georgia. You must be at least 18 to buy ammo in the state, 21 to purchase from Lucky Gunner online.</p>
<h2 id=where-can-i-shoot-my-pellet-gun-in-georgia>Where can I Shoot my pellet gun in Georgia?</h2>
<p>You can hear them pop very easily so you can cause neighbors to freak out a little if not careful. These aren’t always like a red ryder BB gun. My air rifle has the same muzzle velocity as a 22 long rifle. It depends where exactly you live, The City of Marietta which is in Cobb County prohibits the firing of a BB gun within city limits.</p>
<h2 id=can-you-shoot-a-gun-over-your-property-line-in-cobb-county-ga>Can you shoot a gun over your property line in Cobb County GA?</h2>
<p>Cobb County does not allow discharge over your property line. In non-incorporated parts of the county, infrequent discharge won’t be a problem. But if you bug your neighbors it could become a problem from a nuisance or danger standpoint.</p>
<h2 id=where-can-you-shoot-a-bb-gun-in-georgia>Where can you shoot a BB gun in Georgia?</h2>
<p>It depends where exactly you live, The City of Marietta which is in Cobb County prohibits the firing of a BB gun within city limits. 10-4-040 – Firearms and BB guns; discharge prohibited. No person shall fire a gun, pistol or other firearms, or fire or discharge any air gun, commonly known as a BB gun in the city.</p>
<h2 id=is-it-illegal-to-use-a-pellet-gun-in-douglas-county>Is it illegal to use a pellet gun in Douglas County?</h2>
<p>There is, however, local city and county ordinances, but some Counties and Cities don’t seem to address it unless you damage someone’s property or injure someone then it is treated as a dangerous weapon or device. My county Douglas County don’t have any ordnance written to specifically address discharge of a Pellet gun or BB gun.</p>
