<h2 id=what-was-the-goal-for-the-ohio-company>What was the goal for the Ohio company?</h2>
<p>Ohio Company, in U.S. colonial history, organization of Englishmen and Virginians, established in 1748, to promote trade with groups of American Indians and to secure English control of the Ohio River valley. Its activities in an area also claimed by France led to the outbreak of the last French and Indian War (1754).</p>
<h2 id=who-claimed-land-in-the-ohio-valley-for-france>Who claimed land in the Ohio Valley for France?</h2>
<p>By the middle of the 1700s, British fur traders had crossed the Appalachian Mountains into the Ohio River Valley into land that was claimed by both Great Britain and France. The French explorer René-Robert Cavelier, Sieur de La Salle had laid claim to a huge land area called New France.</p>
<h2 id=who-surveyed-the-ohio-country>Who surveyed the Ohio country?</h2>
<p>In return, the king expected the company to distribute the property among one hundred families. The Ohio Company also was to construct a fort to guarantee the colonists’ safety. In 1750, the Ohio Company hired Christopher Gist to survey the land.</p>
<h2 id=which-two-of-the-following-are-responsible-for-the-founding-of-the-ohio-company>Which two of the following are responsible for the founding of the Ohio Company?</h2>
<p>Royal Governor Robert Dinwiddie, George William Fairfax, George Mason, and George’s half-brothers Lawrence and Augustine Washington were all shareholders in the Ohio Company. Founded in 1749, the Ohio Company was created to help encourage settlement and development of the vast Ohio Valley.</p>
<h2 id=who-was-sent-to-protect-the-ohio-company-claim>Who was sent to protect the Ohio company claim?</h2>
<p>In return, the Virginians promised to settle 100 families in the area and erect a fort to protect them and the British claim to the area. In 1750, Christopher Gist was sent into the Ohio Country to explore it and conduct a survey to prepare for settlement.</p>
<h2 id=why-did-virginia-want-to-leave-the-union>Why did Virginia want to leave the Union?</h2>
<p>As long as Virginia stayed in the Union, the “wandering” states of the Confederacy might return to the Union. John S. Carlile of transmontane Alleghany County, like Willey an Unconditional Unionist, stressed that western Virginians were committed to slavery as “essential to American liberty.”</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-purpose-of-the-virginia-secession-convention>What was the purpose of the Virginia Secession Convention?</h2>
<p>Virginia Secession Convention of 1861. The Virginia Secession Convention of 1861 was called in Richmond to determine secession from the United States, to govern the state during a state of emergency, and to write a new Constitution for Virginia, which was subsequently voted down in referendum under the Confederate regime.</p>
<h2 id=who-was-expelled-from-the-virginia-secession-convention>Who was expelled from the Virginia Secession Convention?</h2>
<p>The Convention on June 29, 1861 expelled Unconditional Unionists William G. Brown and James Clark McGrew (who represented transmontane Preston County) for participating in the Wheeling Convention in May, although others had actually attended that convention (which later led to West Virginia statehood). On election day, October 24]</p>
<h2 id=what-happens-if-virginia-joins-the-confederate-states>What happens if Virginia joins the Confederate States?</h2>
<p>If Virginia joined the Confederacy, the North would no longer be bound by the Constitution to stand by slavery and slave-holding states, and it would join with England, France and Spain to extinguish slavery everywhere.</p>
