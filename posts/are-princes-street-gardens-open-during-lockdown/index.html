<p>Opening times:10am-8pm (Summer only). Disabled access. All toilets for the disabled require a RADAR key for access. West Princes Street Gardens (West End).</p>
<h2 id=why-are-west-princes-street-gardens-closed>Why are West Princes Street Gardens closed?</h2>
<p>Edinburgh West Princes Street Gardens closed as floods dredge up sewage issue. Cleaning crews are set to scrub Princes Street Gardens after heavy rainfall brought sewage bubbling to the surface, forcing the historic greenspace to close on one of the hottest days of the year.</p>
<h2 id=what-did-princes-street-gardens-used-to-be>What did Princes Street Gardens used to be?</h2>
<p>Princes Street Gardens was created by draining Edinburgh’s largest loch, the Nor Loch. Nor Loch, which was first a marshland on the north side of Edinburgh had initially been used as a natural Medieval defence along with Edinburgh Castle.</p>
<h2 id=who-does-the-monument-belong-to-in-princes-street-gardens>Who does the monument belong to in Princes Street Gardens?</h2>

<h2 id=can-you-drink-alcohol-in-princes-street-gardens>Can you drink alcohol in Princes Street Gardens?</h2>
<p>Areas such as the Meadows, Princes Street Gardens and Inverleith Park are popular with sun seekers looking to relax with a can of beer or tin of G. But now, due to coronavirus restrictions, it is currently illegal to drink outdoors anywhere in Scotland.</p>
<h2 id=what-shops-are-on-princes-street>What shops are on Princes Street?</h2>
<p>Home to destination and flagship stores such as Marks and Spencer, H&M, Gap and Primark, Princes Street is the place to be to keep up with High Street fashion. Tech enthusiasts will also be in their element, with the Apple Store and Samsung Experience at the east end of the street.</p>
<h2 id=why-is-the-scott-monument-black>Why is the Scott Monument black?</h2>
<p>Over the years, the original pale sandstone and white marble had darkened to sooty black as a result of air pollution. Now Scott’s statue is again white and the new stonework is the original light colour. It was decided not to clean all the sandstone, to prevent further damage.</p>
<h2 id=can-you-go-up-the-scott-monument>Can you go up the Scott Monument?</h2>
<p>If you want to climb to the top of the tower you’ll have to go up 287 steps, which are divided into four levels where you can stop for a while and explore if you wish. As you ascend further up the spiral staircase, it becomes more and more difficult since the walls get narrower and the stairs become unsteady.</p>
<h2 id=can-u-drink-in-the-streets-in-edinburgh>Can u drink in the streets in Edinburgh?</h2>
<p>The City of Edinburgh allows the consumption of alcohol in public places but under the Edinburgh by-law, anyone drinking in public would have to stop if asked by police. In St Andrews in Fife it is illegal to drink or even have an open drinks container on the street.</p>
<h2 id=is-it-illegal-to-drink-in-public-in-edinburgh>Is it illegal to drink in public in Edinburgh?</h2>
<p>Alongside a video “Drinking in The Meadows, Princes Street Gardens, public spaces is illegal”, the council issued this statement on Twitter: “Avoid a fine – don’t go drinking in the Meadows or other parks. It’s against the coronavirus restrictions law. Be safe.”</p>
