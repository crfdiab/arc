<h2 id=what-is-forbidden-by-the-13th-amendment>What is forbidden by the 13th Amendment?</h2>
<p>Passed by Congress on January 31, 1865, and ratified on December 6, 1865, the 13th amendment abolished slavery in the United States and provides that “Neither slavery nor involuntary servitude, except as a punishment for crime whereof the party shall have been duly convicted, shall exist within the United States, or …</p>
<h2 id=are-there-any-situations-in-which-the-thirteenth-amendment-rights-do-not-apply>Are there any situations in which the Thirteenth Amendment rights do not apply?</h2>
<p>Congress shall have power to enforce this article by appropriate legislation. The Thirteenth Amendment has been held inapplicable in a wide range of situations. Similarly, enforcement of those duties that individuals owe the government, “such as services in the army, militia, on the jury, etc. ,” is not covered.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-loophole-in-the-13th-amendment>What was the loophole in the 13th Amendment?</h2>
<p>“The loophole in our constitution’s ban on slavery not only allowed slavery to continue, but launched an era of discrimination and mass incarceration that continues to this day. To live up to our nation’s promise of justice for all, we must eliminate the Slavery Clause from our constitution.”</p>
<h2 id=is-the-military-draft-a-violation-of-the-thirteenth-amendment>Is the military draft a violation of the Thirteenth Amendment?</h2>
<p>The amendment allows for people to be prosecuted for forcing someone to work against their free will. The Supreme Court ruled that the military draft (when the government forces people to join the military) was not a violation of the Thirteenth Amendment. Take a quiz about this page.</p>
<h2 id=are-there-any-laws-that-violate-the-thirteenth-amendment>Are there any laws that violate the Thirteenth Amendment?</h2>
<p>This provision allows Congress to pass laws pertaining to practices that violate the Amendment. For example, the Anti-Peonage Act of 1867 prohibits peonage, and another federal law, 18 U.S.C. § 1592, makes it a crime to take somebody’s passport or other official documents for the purpose of holding her as a slave.</p>
<h2 id=how-is-involuntary-servitude-banned-in-the-thirteenth-amendment>How is involuntary servitude banned in the Thirteenth Amendment?</h2>
<p>However, the Amendment also bars “involuntary servitude,” which covers a broader range of labor arrangements where a person is forced to work by the use or threatened use of physical or legal coercion. For example, the Thirteenth Amendment bans peonage, which occurs when a person is compelled to work to pay off a debt.</p>
<h2 id=how-is-section-2-of-the-thirteenth-amendment-enforced>How is Section 2 of the Thirteenth Amendment enforced?</h2>
<p>Section Two of the Thirteenth Amendment empowers Congress to “enforce” the ban on slavery and involuntary servitude “by appropriate legislation.” According to the Supreme Court, federal laws passed pursuant to this provision can address a broader range of discriminatory conduct than just coerced labor.</p>
