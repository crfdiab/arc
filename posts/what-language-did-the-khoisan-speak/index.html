<h2 id=what-language-did-the-khoisan-speak>What language did the Khoisan speak?</h2>
<p>The only widespread Khoisan language is Khoekhoe (also known as Khoekhoegowab, Nàmá or Damara) of Namibia, Botswana and South Africa, with a quarter of a million speakers; Sandawe in Tanzania is second in number with some 40–80,000, some monolingual; and the ǃKung language of the northern Kalahari spoken by some 16,000 …</p>
<h2 id=did-the-khoikhoi-farm>Did the Khoikhoi farm?</h2>
<p>The Khoi taught the first farmers to make medicine from plants and shared their religious ideas. They had to stay in one place long enough to plant and harvest their crops. They built permanent homes near their fields. Archeologists have found the remains of many iron-age villages.</p>
<h2 id=what-did-the-khoisan-people-do-for-a-living>What did the Khoisan people do for a living?</h2>
<p>These people, today called the Khoisan, were skilled hunter-gatherers and nomadic farmers who lived off the land. And yet, in spite of their earliest presence on the land, they’re among the country’s most persecuted people.</p>
<h2 id=where-did-the-khoi-people-get-their-food-from>Where did the Khoi people get their food from?</h2>
<p>The distinct origin of the Khoi is debated. Over time, some Khoi abandoned pastoralism and adopted the hunter-gatherer economy of the San, probably due to a drying climate, and are now considered San. Similarly, the Bantu Damara people who migrated south later abandoned agriculture and adopted the Khoi economy.</p>
<h2 id=when-did-the-bantu-people-overtake-the-khoisans>When did the Bantu people overtake the Khoisans?</h2>
<p>The Bantu people, with advanced agriculture and metalworking technology, outcompeted and intermarried with the Khoisan, becoming the dominant population of South-Eastern Africa before the arrival of the Dutch colonists in 1652.</p>
<h2 id=how-big-is-the-population-of-khoi-sung>How big is the population of Khoi Sung?</h2>
<p>The population of Khoi Sung is 4,255. When was Khoi Vinh born? Khoi Vinh was born in 1971. Who are the khoi khoi herders? they are the other early inhabitants of southern Africa How did the Khoisan preserve their food? The Khoi and the San peoples of southern Africa have two distinct food cultures.</p>
