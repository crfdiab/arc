<p>Amerigo Vespucci<br>
The mapmaker, Martin Waldseemüller, named the New World “America,” after the Italian Amerigo Vespucci, who had explored the coastline of South America and was the first to realize that it was a separate continent, not part of Asia.</p>
<h2 id=who-first-recognized-that-the-americas-were-in-fact-a-new-world-and-not-asia>Who first recognized that the Americas were in fact a New World and not Asia?</h2>
<p>And that was the realization that what he was looking at was not India at all, but an entirely new continent. He verified the fact by following the coast of South America down to within 400 miles of Tierra del Fuego. Columbus found the new world, but Vespucci was the man who recognized that it was a new world.</p>

<p>explorer Christopher Columbus<br>
The explorer Christopher Columbus made four trips across the Atlantic Ocean from Spain: in 1492, 1493, 1498 and 1502. He was determined to find a direct water route west from Europe to Asia, but he never did. Instead, he stumbled upon the Americas.</p>
<h2 id=does-columbus-realize-that-the-americas-are-not-part-of-asia>Does Columbus realize that the Americas are not part of Asia?</h2>
<p>He was not aware that the Americas are not a part of Asia. Presents the views that Christopher Columbus sees. He thought he could have reached Asia and desired his statements. It was later on that America was named after Amerigo Vespucci who realized America was not part Asia.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-americas-real-name>What is Americas real name?</h2>
<p>America is named after Amerigo Vespucci, the Italian explorer who set forth the then revolutionary concept that the lands that Christopher Columbus sailed to in 1492 were part of a separate continent.</p>

<h2 id=who-was-the-first-european-to-reach-north-america>Who was the first European to reach North America?</h2>
<p>Under the leadership of an Icelandic Viking, Leif Erikson , the Norsemen successfully traversed the ocean and reached the coast of North America. This occurred around 1000 AD, almost five centuries before Columbus. In 1492, the Italian explorer Christopher Columbus was the first European that reached the islands of the Caribbean.</p>

<p>Columbus and Later Explorations (1492–1519) 1492–1493: Italian explorer Christopher Columbus makes three voyages paid for by the Spanish and lands on islands off the coast of the North American continent, not realizing he has found a new land.</p>
