<h2 id=does-apple-have-a-toll-free-number>Does Apple have a toll free number?</h2>
<p>You can buy online or call (800) MY–APPLE (800–692–7753).</p>
<h2 id=does-apple-have-a-24-hour-helpline>Does Apple have a 24 hour helpline?</h2>
<p>Apple’s online support provides the most comprehensive support information available from Apple. Apple online support inlcudes software updates and utilities, technical support and product information and is available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.</p>
<h2 id=how-do-i-get-a-1888-number>How do I get a 1888 number?</h2>
<p>You can contact a RespOrg if you want to obtain a toll free number. If you need help locating a RespOrg, call or text the Somos Help Desk at 1-844-HEY SOMOS (1-844-439-7666), or visit <a href=http://www.somos.com/find-a-toll-free-number>www.somos.com/find-a-toll-free-number</a> for assistance. The FCC sets the rules for getting and using toll free numbers.</p>
<h2 id=does-apple-ever-contact-you-by-phone>Does Apple ever contact you by phone?</h2>
<p>No, Apple NEVER initiates telephone contact with a customer. It’s a scam. If you’ve changed your Apple ID password then you should be safe as long as you provided no other personal info or gave them access to your Mac. Apple will never call you.</p>
<h2 id=whats-the-phone-number-to-applecare>What’s the phone number to AppleCare?</h2>
<p>800-275-2273<br>
By calling 800-275-2273 (requires you to run a remote diagnostic and provide proof of purchase)</p>
<h2 id=is-there-a-24-hour-apple-support-number-india>Is there a 24 hour Apple Support Number India?</h2>
<p>You can buy online or call 000800 040 1966. You can get information about an order you placed on the Apple Online Store through the Order Status page. If you prefer, you can also get order status or make changes by phone at 000800 040 1966.</p>
<h2 id=are-calls-from-apple-support-real>Are calls from Apple Support real?</h2>
<p>If you get an unsolicited or suspicious phone call from someone claiming to be from Apple or Apple Support, just hang up. You can report scam phone calls to the Federal Trade Commission (U.S. only) at reportfraud.ftc.gov or to your local law enforcement agency.</p>
<h2 id=what-area-code-is-888-belong-to>What area code is 888 belong to?</h2>
<p>Area Code 888 is utilized. For Toll Free Calls Although area code 888 is not assigned to a geographical area or time zone, calls to any toll free number may be restricted by the customer. Other toll free area codes are 800, 833, 844, 855, 866, and 877.</p>
<h2 id=is-888-a-lucky-number>Is 888 a lucky number?</h2>
<p>On its own, the number 8 is often associated with great fortune, wealth and spiritual enlightenment. Hence, 888 is considered triple. For this reason, addresses and phone numbers containing the digit sequence 888 are considered particularly lucky, and may command a premium because of it.</p>
<h2 id=does-apple-call-you-if-you-have-been-hacked>Does Apple call you if you have been hacked?</h2>
<p>Keep in mind, Apple will never call to alert you of a hack. If you accidentally pick up, hang up as soon as possible and do not provide any personal information, nor perform any tasks that scammer wants you to do with your computer.</p>
<h2 id=do-you-need-a-toll-free-number-for-a-cell-phone>Do you need a toll free number for a cell phone?</h2>
<p>You don’t need to set up expensive business phone service just to get a simple toll free number that forwards to your cell phone.</p>
<h2 id=can-you-get-a-free-cell-phone-number-with-youmail>Can you get a free cell phone number with YouMail?</h2>
<p>With YouMail, you can get a free phone number that adds a second phone line to your cell phone. One phone with two numbers, as simple as that. With a free phone number from YouMail, your existing number works just like before. You can call with it, or send and receive text messages, just like you might expect.</p>
<h2 id=how-do-i-get-a-phone-number-for-my-iphone>How do I get a phone number for my iPhone?</h2>
<p>All account management is done through its website, and that, confusingly, includes placing a call. You have to type in the number you want to call and the number of a phone near you. In turn, the service calls your number and asks you to press 1 to complete the the call to the other party.</p>
<h2 id=is-the-toll-free-number-the-same-as-the-other-number>Is the toll free number the same as the other number?</h2>
<p>Toll free numbers are called the same way you would any other number. Just be sure to dial “1” followed by the correct toll free prefix (800, 833, 844, 855, 866, 877, or 888). Toll free prefixes are not interchangeable. In other words, dialing 1 (800) 123-4567 would not route your call to the same place as 1 (800) 123-4567.</p>
