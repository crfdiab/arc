<h2 id=what-are-balanced-ecosystems>What are balanced ecosystems?</h2>
<p>A balanced ecosystem signifies a habitat which is sustainable. It consists of animals, plants, microorganisms and more which depend on each other and their surroundings. These ecosystems exhibit resourceful energy and material cycling. It also displays interconnectedness amid primary producers and predators.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-a-collection-of-ecosystems>What is a collection of ecosystems?</h2>
<p>Biome: A very large ecosystem or collection of ecosystems with similar biotic and abiotic factors such as an entire Rainforest with millions of animals and trees, with many different water bodies running through them.</p>

<h2 id=which-is-statement-concerning-an-ecosystem-is-correct>Which is statement concerning an ecosystem is correct?</h2>
<p>Which statement concerning an ecosystem is correct? (1) It can exist with or without a constant source of energy input. (2) It must contain consumers but can exist without producers. (3) It involves interactions between biotic and abiotic factors. (4) It can exist on land, but it cannot exist in lakes, rivers, or oceans. 2.</p>
<h2 id=which-is-correct-statement-concerning-a-living-environment>Which is correct statement concerning a living environment?</h2>
<p>a me: The Living Environment Class: Ms. Fazio 1. Which statement concerning an ecosystem is correct? (1) It can exist with or without a constant source of energy input.

<h2 id=which-is-true-about-the-productivity-of-an-ecosystem>Which is true about the productivity of an ecosystem?</h2>
<p>4. Ecosystem does not have its own productivity Ecosystem is the dynamic community of living organism with physical environment. Thus, it comprises of both biotic and abiotic components. Solar energy is the ultimate source of energy in it, so is the main driving force.</p>
<h2 id=what-makes-an-ecosystem-most-likely-to-remain-stable>What makes an ecosystem most likely to remain stable?</h2>
<p>An ecosystem will most likely remain stable if (1) it has more predators than prey (2) it has a high level of biodiversity (3) biotic factors decrease (4) finite resources decrease 11. Cutting down a rain forest and planting agricultural crops,</p>
