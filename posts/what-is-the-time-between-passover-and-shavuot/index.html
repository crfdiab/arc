<h2 id=what-is-the-time-between-passover-and-shavuot>What is the time between Passover and Shavuot?</h2>
<p>seven weeks<br>
How do we know when to observe Shavuot? Count seven weeks (49 days) from Passover. The 50th day is Shavuot. And that, actually, is the literal meaning of the word “Shavuot”—“weeks!” May these weeks of counting lead you to both liberation and renewed commitment.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-time-between-passover-and-pentecost>What is the time between Passover and Pentecost?</h2>
<p>Pentecost, sometimes thought to be “a Christian celebration,” began with roots deep in the Jewish faith, a picture of consecration, recognizing all we own is a gift from God. The word means “50 days,” or seven weeks after Passover, celebrated when the people harvested their grain, offering a “tithe” of it to God.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-the-3-days-before-shavuot-called>What are the 3 days before Shavuot called?</h2>
<p>In Sephardi communities, the Shabbat before Shavuot is called “Shabbat Kallah”. The Torah is likened to a bride, and the Jewish people to a bridegroom coming to meet his bride.</p>
<h2 id=what-happened-on-the-day-of-shavuot>What happened on the day of Shavuot?</h2>

<p>Pentecost is the festival when Christians celebrate the gift of the Holy Spirit. It is celebrated on the Sunday 50 days after Easter (the name comes from the Greek pentekoste, “fiftieth”). Pentecost is regarded as the birthday of the Christian church, and the start of the church’s mission to the world.</p>
<h2 id=why-is-pentecost-50-days-passover>Why is Pentecost 50 days Passover?</h2>
<p>Also happening 50 days after the first Passover was the arrival of the children of Israel at Mount Sinai, where Moses received the Ten Commandment law. Fifty days after Jesus’ resurrection was the first Pentecost. God’s forgiveness can only be found in the redemption work of his Son, Jesus Christ.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-the-symbols-of-shavuot>What are the symbols of Shavuot?</h2>
<p>An important symbol of Shavuot is the Bikkurim, or first fruits. This was a basket of gold or silver that contained the first harvest of the Seven Species crops and was carried to the Temple in Jerusalem in a procession accompanied by music. These crops are: barley; dates; figs; grapes; olives; pomegranates; and wheat.</p>
<h2 id=why-do-we-wear-white-on-shavuot>Why do we wear white on Shavuot?</h2>

In Biblical times, Passover began at twilight on the fourteenth day of Nissan, and then the next day, day 15, the Feast of Unleavened Bread would begin and continue for seven days.</p>
<h2 id=when-is-the-first-day-of-passover-2022>When is the first day of Passover 2022?</h2>

<p>In the second month on the fourteenth day at twilight they shall keep it” (Num 9:10–11). This makeup observation of the Passover is what has been traditionally identified as the second Passover.</p>
