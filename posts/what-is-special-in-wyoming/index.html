<h2 id=what-is-special-in-wyoming>What is special in Wyoming?</h2>

<h2 id=is-there-anything-good-in-wyoming>Is there anything good in Wyoming?</h2>
<p>Wyoming is one of the best places to experience America’s natural wonders – it has 12 state parks, five national forests, four wildlife refuges, and two national parks (Grand Teton and Yellowstone).</p>
<h2 id=whats-the-number-one-attraction-in-wyoming>What’s the number one attraction in Wyoming?</h2>
<p>1: Yellowstone National Park Your Wyoming vacation would not be complete without a visit to the Yellowstone National Park. Driving through the main roads, you will enjoy some of the most scenic views then have a fun picnic on one of the roadside parks.</p>
<h2 id=is-wyoming-friendly>Is Wyoming friendly?</h2>
<p>Yes but it is very difficult to find the people in Wyoming. It is one of the least densely populated states in the USA. There are more tourists in Yellowstone and Grand Teton National Parks than there are natives in the rest of the state on the farms and ranches. Wyoming natives are very friendly for the most part.</p>
<h2 id=what-food-is-wyoming-known-for>What food is Wyoming known for?</h2>
<p>5 Iconic Foods to Try in Wyoming</p>

<li>Chili.</li>
<li>Chokecherry Jam.</li>
<li>Rocky Mountain Oysters.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id=what-are-the-most-popular-things-to-do-in-wyoming>What are the most popular things to do in Wyoming?</h2>

<h2 id=are-there-any-national-parks-in-the-state-of-wyoming>Are there any national parks in the state of Wyoming?</h2>
<p>Some of the country’s most beloved national parks are located in Wyoming, and the state’s residents are big on the outdoors. Here are 15 things to know before moving to Wyoming.</p>
<h2 id=what-kind-of-life-is-there-in-wyoming>What kind of Life Is there in Wyoming?</h2>
<p>Wyoming has a definite cowboy vibe that might remind you of what you’d find in Texas. Cowboy boots and trucks are big in Wyoming, and ranching and rodeos are part of life. The western way of life is held dear in Wyoming, with some towns hosting weekly rodeos in the summer.</p>
<h2 id=what-do-you-need-to-know-about-moving-to-wyoming>What do you need to know about moving to Wyoming?</h2>
<p>Wyoming is home to Yellowstone National Park. That’s reason enough in itself to move here. The supervolcano may blow the U.S. off the map one day but, until then, this state gets to be home to one of the best natural beauties in the whole country. 10.</p>
