<h2 id=who-has-final-authority-in-a-confederation>Who has final authority in a confederation?</h2>
<p>A number of years elapsed between the approval of the draft of the Articles of Confederation by the Continental Congress in late 1777 and the ratification by the final state in 1781. Under the Articles of Confederation, the power of the national government was exclusively centered in the Congress.</p>
<h2 id=what-keeps-any-one-branch-of-government-from-becoming-too-powerful>What keeps any one branch of government from becoming too powerful?</h2>
<p>The system of checks and balances stops one branch of the federal government from becoming too powerful. The United States government is divided into three separate branches. Checks and balances stop one branch of the government from becoming too powerful.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-final-authority-under-the-federal-system>What was the final authority under the federal system?</h2>
<p>The federal government’s authority superseded state authority in those national areas but left state authority that did not conflict with the federal authority intact. Judicial matters that arose only under state law were left to the state courts to handle.</p>
<h2 id=when-does-the-state-supreme-court-have-final-authority>When does the state Supreme Court have final authority?</h2>
<p>The State Supreme Court has final authority over State law matters, even when the core issue involves a federal statute such as Section 218. For example, whether a political subdivision is created or dissolved is a matter of State law and the questions of fact and law are properly decided by the State courts,…</p>
<h2 id=who-is-the-highest-authority-in-the-federal-court-system>Who is the highest authority in the federal court system?</h2>
<p>Congress created the federal court system in the Judiciary Act of 1789, under the authority of Article III, Section 1 of the Constitution. Who has the highest authority in the federal court system? The Supreme Court of the United States, for matters that fall under its jurisdiction.</p>
<h2 id=how-is-the-final-rule-consistent-with-federalism>How is the final rule consistent with federalism?</h2>
<p>The final rule is consistent with U.S. principles of federalism (the relationship between the federal government and state/local governments). By statute, federal public health regulations do not preempt state or local public health regulations, except in the event of a conflict with the exercise of federal authority.</p>
