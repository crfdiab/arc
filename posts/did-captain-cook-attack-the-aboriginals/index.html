<h2 id=did-captain-cook-attack-the-aboriginals>Did Captain Cook attack the aboriginals?</h2>
<p>He described the men discharging spears in his party’s direction, hence the need to fire. He also described wandering towards a dwelling area and collecting spears from that area. From this account, Australia’s history shows that Cook was attacked by ‘natives’.</p>
<h2 id=did-james-cook-meet-the-aboriginals>Did James Cook meet the aboriginals?</h2>
<p>In 1770 Captain James Cook met few Aboriginal people on the Eastern Australian shoreline. They were both wrong, as the Gadigal and other local Aboriginal people later proved by ambushing the convicts who were often sent to work into the bush.</p>
<h2 id=when-did-captain-cook-invade-the-aboriginals>When did Captain Cook invade the aboriginals?</h2>
<p>April 29, 1770<br>
Our understanding of the events that unfolded on the afternoon of April 29, 1770 come mostly from the journals of Captain Cook and his crew. They describe sailing into the harbour and being threatened and warned off by the Indigenous people on the shore.</p>
<h2 id=is-captain-cook-a-hero-or-a-villain>Is Captain Cook a hero or a villain?</h2>
<p>Captain James Cook was not only a hero in Britain — his fame spread throughout Europe, as readers devoured accounts of his voyages translated into many languages. The veneration of Cook transcended even France and Britain’s fierce imperial rivalry.</p>
<h2 id=what-did-james-cook-think-of-māori>What did James Cook think of Māori?</h2>
<p>The local Māori were mystified by Cook’s great ship, reportedly believing that it was a floating island or a giant bird. A number of armed men approached the boat, in what some experts think was a “ceremonial challenge,” according to a New Zealand government site.</p>
<h2 id=what-happened-when-captain-cook-landed-in-new-zealand>What happened when Captain Cook landed in New Zealand?</h2>
<p>The English navigator Captain James Cook sighted New Zealand on 6 October 1769, and landed at Poverty Bay two days later. He drew detailed and accurate maps of the country, and wrote about the Māori people. His first encounter with Māori was not successful – a fight broke out in which some Māori were killed.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-captain-james-cook-interact-with-the-indigenous-australians>How did Captain James Cook interact with the Indigenous Australians?</h2>
<p>Unbeknown to Captain James Cook, Aboriginal Australians had been interacting with explorers and traders for centuries before he landed on the east coast of Australia. Research is now examining the interactions with the Dutch, the Spanish, the Portuguese, the French, and the Makassans from Indonesia.</p>
<h2 id=when-did-james-cook-claim-the-eastern-part-of-australia>When did James Cook claim the eastern part of Australia?</h2>
<p>Lieutenant James Cook, captain of HMB Endeavour, claimed the eastern portion of the Australian continent for the British Crown in 1770, naming it New South Wales.</p>
<h2 id=where-did-james-cook-land-in-new-south-wales>Where did James Cook land in New South Wales?</h2>
<p>Dr Shayne T. Williams, Ph.D, looks at how James Cook’s landing in New South Wales, Australia might have been experienced and interpreted by the Gweagal people. I grew up on the Aboriginal reserve at La Perouse on the northern arm of Botany Bay.</p>
<h2 id=when-did-captain-cook-first-come-to-australia>When did Captain Cook first come to Australia?</h2>
<p>“They must have had so little to do with them during the short stay of Captain Cook that they must not have seen many.” Another interesting fact was that Cook had not yet been made a captain when he arrived in Australia in 1770. He was in fact a lieutenant at the time. “But everyone says Captain Cook because it sounds better,” Prof McGrath said.</p>
