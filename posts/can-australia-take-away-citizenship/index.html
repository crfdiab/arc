<h2 id=can-australia-take-away-citizenship>Can Australia take away citizenship?</h2>
<p>Australian citizenship may be revoked if a person has committed a serious offence. A conviction with a sentence of 12 months or more might result in the revocation of citizenship. It can also be revoked if it is found that there was third party fraud in the process of applying for Australian citizenship.</p>
<h2 id=can-a-british-citizen-lose-uk-residency>Can a British Citizen lose UK residency?</h2>
<p>If you’ve been away from the UK for more than two years, your ILR or settled status will be lost. You will have to apply for a Returning Resident visa. It’s up to the discretion of the Home Office to grant the visa, and you’ll have to prove that you plan to return and live in the UK permanently.</p>
<h2 id=can-british-citizenship-lapse>Can British Citizenship lapse?</h2>
<p>Absences from the UK of more than 2 years Where a person is absent from the UK for more than 2 years, their indefinite leave will automatically lapse.</p>
<h2 id=how-long-can-a-british-citizen-stay-outside-uk>How long can a British Citizen stay outside UK?</h2>
<p>Permitted absences of up to 6 months You are allowed to spend time outside of the UK so long as these periods of absence do not exceed 6 months at any one time.</p>
<h2 id=am-i-still-a-uk-resident-if-i-live-abroad>Am I still a UK resident if I live abroad?</h2>
<p>You can live abroad and still be a UK resident for tax, for example if you visit the UK for more than 183 days in a tax year. You usually have to pay tax on your income from outside the UK as well.</p>
<h2 id=can-you-enter-uk-with-expired-british-passport>Can you enter UK with expired British passport?</h2>
<p>You can always enter the UK as a British citizen,even with an expired passport. The immigration officer should be able to check the database on his computer,and you will be straight through.</p>
<h2 id=does-uk-allow-dual-citizenship>Does UK allow dual citizenship?</h2>
<p>Our policy on dual nationality The United Kingdom: recognises dual nationality. allows British nationals who have dual nationality, to hold a British passport.</p>
<h2 id=can-i-lose-my-british-citizenship-if-i-live-abroad>Can I lose my British citizenship if I live abroad?</h2>
<p>Your citizenship will not be impacted if you move or retire abroad. This means that you will not lose your British citizenship if you move to another country. You may, however, wish to acquire dual citizenship if you seek to permanently reside in another country and would like to become a citizen of that country.</p>
<h2 id=can-i-have-dual-citizenship-in-australia-and-uk>Can I have dual citizenship in Australia and UK?</h2>
<p>Both Australia and the United Kingdom allow Dual Nationality. This means that a person can hold nationality (and the passport) of both countries.</p>
<h2 id=can-you-force-a-sale-of-jointly-owned-property-in-victoria>Can you force a sale of jointly owned property in Victoria?</h2>
<p>Can you force a sale of jointly owned property in Victoria? If the parties are married or in a de facto relationship, then the Family Court of Australia will have jurisdiction deal with those disputes.</p>
<h2 id=can-a-non-resident-of-the-uk-sell-a-property-in-the-uk>Can a non resident of the UK sell a property in the UK?</h2>
<p>To avoid paying this tax, a property owner could sell their assets after living outside of the UK for one year or more. These non-residents could, therefore, avoid the CGT charge entirely, and make a significant profit on a sale as a result. The loophole has since been closed, with a change to the law made in April 2015.</p>
<h2 id=can-a-property-settlement-order-be-enforceable-outside-of-australia>Can a property settlement order be enforceable outside of Australia?</h2>
<p>However, property settlement orders made by the Australian Family Courts may not be automatically recognised and enforceable in the overseas jurisdiction. Consequently, problems may be experienced in enforcing the property settlement orders internationally. For example, the Courts may take into account a number of factors such as:</p>
<h2 id=can-a-australian-own-an-asset-in-the-uk>Can a Australian own an asset in the UK?</h2>
<p>Similar issues can arise for Australians owning UK assets, which have become more attractive because of the exchange rate and individuals working abroad. With information sharing between tax authorities now the norm, it is no longer possible to ignore this.</p>
