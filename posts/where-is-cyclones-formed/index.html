<h2 id=where-is-cyclones-formed>Where is cyclones formed?</h2>
<p>Cyclones form in low-pressure zones over warm intertropical seas. Tropical cyclone, also called typhoon or hurricane, an intense circular storm that originates over warm tropical oceans and is characterized by low atmospheric pressure, high winds, and heavy rain.</p>
<h2 id=how-are-cyclones-formed-7>How are cyclones formed 7?</h2>
<p>A Cyclone is a large scale air mass that rotates around strong centers of low pressure. Water vapors are formed when water is heated. This repeats till a low pressure system with surrounding high speed winds is created. This is called a Cyclone.</p>
<h2 id=how-do-cyclones-start>How do cyclones start?</h2>
<p>How do tropical cyclones form? A cluster of thunderstorms can develop over warm tropical oceans. If that cluster persists in an area of low pressure, it can start rotating. If the conditions are just right, the cluster of thunderstorms can grow in size and sustain itself and then develop into a tropical cyclone.</p>
<h2 id=how-are-cyclones-formed-8>How are cyclones formed 8?</h2>
<p>Formation of cyclone A cyclone arises due to the difference in the temperatures between two regions. Low pressure is created as the air in the high-temperature region becomes warm and rises. The gap in the low-pressure area is filled by cold air rushing in from the surrounding areas.</p>
<h2 id=why-is-it-called-a-cyclone>Why is it called a cyclone?</h2>
<p>“Cyclone” was coined in the late 18th century by a British official in India, from the Greek for “moving in a circle.” But a storm by any other name should still be taken seriously.</p>
<h2 id=who-is-responsible-for-cyclones>Who is responsible for cyclones?</h2>
<p>There are six factors responsible for the formation of the cyclone: (1) Sufficient warm temperature at sea surface (2) atmospheric instability (3) impact area of Coriolis force so that low pressure can be developed (4) high humidity in the lower to middle levels of the troposphere (5) a pre-existing low-level focus or …</p>
<h2 id=where-are-tropical-cyclones-formed-in-the-world>Where are tropical cyclones formed in the world?</h2>
<p>Tropical cyclones are variously called as typhoons and hurricanes in different countries. These cyclones are formed over places in the oceans near the equator, where water is warmer. Moist air laden with water rises upwards from the surface of these oceans to leave behind an area of low air pressure.</p>
<h2 id=what-do-you-need-to-know-about-cyclones>What do you need to know about cyclones?</h2>
<p>Before learning how is a cyclone formed, you must know that cyclones are low-pressure storm systems that are spinning and carry high-speed winds with water capable of causing destruction to property and lives.</p>
<h2 id=why-do-cyclones-form-from-the-north-to-south-pole>Why do cyclones form from the north to South Pole?</h2>
<p>The air flow pattern as we go from the North to South Pole varies according to the figure given above. This occurs because of the rotation of the earth. So when there is a low pressure area in the sub-tropical region, hot air and cold air rush in to fill this low pressure. Just like when you burst a balloon.</p>
<h2 id=what-makes-a-tropical-cyclone-different-from-a-tornado>What makes a tropical cyclone different from a tornado?</h2>
<p>What makes each cyclone unique is its location. Tornadoes occur over land, polar cyclones occur in polar regions and tropical cyclones occur over tropical oceans. What’s not unique is how these storms develop. Warm air rises, and it likes to take water along with it.</p>
