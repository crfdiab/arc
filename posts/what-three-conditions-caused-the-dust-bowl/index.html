<h2 id=what-three-conditions-caused-the-dust-bowl>What three conditions caused the Dust Bowl?</h2>
<p>What circumstances conspired to cause the Dust Bowl? Economic depression coupled with extended drought, unusually high temperatures, poor agricultural practices and the resulting wind erosion all contributed to making the Dust Bowl. The seeds of the Dust Bowl may have been sowed during the early 1920s.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-dust-bowl-describe-the-living-conditions-of-those-affected-by-the-dust-bowl>What was the Dust Bowl describe the living conditions of those affected by the Dust Bowl?</h2>
<p>The Dust Bowl was the name given to the drought-stricken Southern Plains region of the United States, which suffered severe dust storms during a dry period in the 1930s. As high winds and choking dust swept the region from Texas to Nebraska, people and livestock were killed and crops failed across the entire region.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-results-of-the-dust-bowl>What was the results of the Dust Bowl?</h2>
<p>Results of a Dust Storm, Oklahoma, 1936. Between 1930 and 1940, the southwestern Great Plains region of the United States suffered a severe drought. Once a semi-arid grassland, the treeless plains became home to thousands of settlers when, in 1862, Congress passed the Homestead Act.</p>
<h2 id=what-areas-did-the-dust-bowl-affect>What areas did the Dust Bowl affect?</h2>
<p>Dust Bowl, section of the Great Plains of the United States that extended over southeastern Colorado, southwestern Kansas, the panhandles of Texas and Oklahoma, and northeastern New Mexico. The term Dust Bowl was suggested by conditions that struck the region in the early 1930s.</p>

<h2 id=what-was-the-climate-like-in-the-dust-bowl>What was the climate like in the Dust Bowl?</h2>
<p>The Plains region of the United States has a semi-arid, or steppe climate. The next driest to desert climates, semi-arid climates receive less than 20 inches (510 mm) of rainfall per year which makes drought a serious weather hazard. The plains are a broad expanse of flat land positioned to the east of the Rocky Mountains.</p>
<h2 id=how-big-was-the-dust-bowl-in-1933>How big was the Dust Bowl in 1933?</h2>
<p>In 1933, the number of dust storms climbed to 38, nearly three times as many as the year before. At its worst, the Dust Bowl covered about 100 million acres in the Southern Plains, an area roughly the size of Pennsylvania. Dust storms also swept across the northern prairies of the United States and Canada]</p>
<h2 id=how-can-we-avoid-a-dust-bowl-in-the-great-plains>How can we avoid a Dust Bowl in the Great Plains?</h2>
<p>Sustainable agriculture and soil conservation practices could help avoid another dust bowl, but experts aren’t sure that such measures will be enough if extended and severe drought revisits the Great Plains. Tilling is a method of turning over the top layer of soil to remove weeds and add fertilizers and pesticides.</p>
