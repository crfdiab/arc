<h2 id=how-long-were-nazca-lines>How long were Nazca Lines?</h2>
<p>WHERE ARE THE NAZCA LINES? The lines are located about 200 miles south of Lima, the Peruvian capital. The area has 800 straight lines, 300 geometric figures, and 70 designs of animals and plants. Some of the lines are around 30 miles long and some are 1,200 feet long.</p>

<p>2,000 years ago<br>
The Nazca lines, a Unesco World Heritage site, is home to designs on the ground – known as geoglyphs – created some 2,000 years ago. Scientists believe the cat, as with other Nazca animal figures, was created by making depressions in the desert floor, leaving coloured earth exposed.</p>

<p>800 straight lines<br>
Were aliens involved? The lines are found in a region of Peru just over 200 miles southeast of Lima, near the modern town of Nasca. In total, there are over 800 straight lines, 300 geometric figures and 70 animal and plant designs, also called biomorphs.</p>
<h2 id=where-are-the-nazca-lines-located-in-peru>Where are the Nazca Lines located in Peru?</h2>
<p>Nazca Lines and Aliens? The Nazca Lines are a collection of giant geoglyphs—designs or motifs etched into the ground—located in the Peruvian coastal plain about 250 miles (400 kilometers) south of Lima, Peru.</p>

<p>And in 2018, a commercial truck driver was arrested after he drove onto a portion of the Nazca Lines, etching deep scars into an area roughly 100 feet by 330 feet (about 50 meters by 100 meters). The damage caused by the truck driver renewed calls for greater security and surveillance at the sites.</p>

<p>Most lines run straight across the landscape, but there are also figurative designs of animals and plants. The individual figurative geoglyph designs measure between 400 and 1,100 metres (440–1,200 yd) across. The combined length of all the lines is over 1,300 km (800 mi), and the group covers an area of about 50 km 2 (19 sq mi).</p>

<p>Anthropologists believe the Nazca culture, which began around 100 B.C. and flourished from A.D. 1 to 700, created the majority of the Nazca Lines.</p>
