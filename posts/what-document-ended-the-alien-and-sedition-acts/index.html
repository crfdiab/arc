<h2 id=how-did-federalists-view-the-alien-and-sedition-acts>How did Federalists view the Alien and Sedition Acts?</h2>
<p>The Federalists believed that Democratic-Republican criticism of Federalist policies was disloyal and feared that aliens living in the United States would sympathize with the French during a war. As a result, a Federalist-controlled Congress passed four laws, known collectively as the Alien and Sedition Acts.</p>

<p>The Alien and Sedition Acts were a series of four laws passed by the U.S. Congress in 1798 amid widespread fear that war with France was imminent. The four laws–which remain controversial to this day–restricted the activities of foreign residents in the country and limited freedom of speech and of the press.</p>

<p>What Were The Alien and Sedition Acts? The Alien and Sedition Acts were a series of four laws passed by the U.S. Congress in 1798 amid widespread fear that war with France was imminent. The four laws–which remain controversial to this day–restricted the activities of foreign residents in the country and limited freedom of speech and of the press.</p>

<p>Text of the Sedition Act. The Alien and Sedition Acts were four bills passed by the Federalist-dominated 5th United States Congress and signed into law by President John Adams in 1798.</p>
<h2 id=who-was-the-first-person-indicted-under-the-alien-and-sedition-acts>Who was the first person indicted under the alien and Sedition Acts?</h2>
<p>Matthew Lyon was a Democratic-Republican congressman from Vermont. He was the first individual to be placed on trial under the Alien and Sedition Acts. He was indicted in 1800 for an essay he had written in the Vermont Journal accusing the administration of “ridiculous pomp, foolish adulation, and selfish avarice.”</p>
<h2 id=when-did-the-alien-friends-and-sedition-act-expire>When did the alien friends and Sedition Act expire?</h2>
<p>The Alien Friends Act expired two years after its passage, and the Sedition Act expired on 3 March 1801, while the Naturalization Act and Alien Enemies Act had no expiration clause. The Federalists argued that the bills strengthened national security during the Quasi-War, an undeclared naval war with France from 1798 to 1800.</p>
