<h2 id=what-are-the-challenges-faced-by-the-people-in-jamaica>What are the challenges faced by the people in Jamaica?</h2>
<p>Unfortunately, the luxurious tourist resorts on the island do not represent the reality of the country and its 2.8 million residents living in poverty. The high rate of unemployment in Jamaica elevates the instability of the population as well as crime and gang problems, particularly drugs.</p>
<h2 id=is-jamaica-a-very-poor-country>Is Jamaica a very poor country?</h2>
<p>Jamaica is considered to be one of the slowest and most unstable economies in the world, weakened by high debt rates. As for today, Jamaica’s poverty rate has improved, with a 1.7 percent growth of GDP during 2016 and an expected 2 percent for 2017. Many reforms have been instituted to reduce the country’s debt.</p>
<h2 id=what-percentage-of-jamaica-is-rich>What percentage of Jamaica is rich?</h2>
<p>These extremes are reflected in the nation’s distribution of income: in 1996 the wealthiest 20 percent of Jamaicans controlled 43.9 percent of the wealth, while the poorest 20 percent controlled only 7 percent. In fact, the poorest 60 percent controlled just 34.3 percent of wealth.</p>
<h2 id=why-did-the-british-move-the-buccaneers-to-jamaica>Why did the British move the Buccaneers to Jamaica?</h2>
<p>The British military governor, concerned about the possibility of Spanish assaults, urged buccaneers to move to Jamaica, and the island’s ports soon became their safe havens; Port Royal, in particular, gained notoriety for its great wealth and lawlessness. The buccaneers relentlessly attacked Spanish Caribbean cities and commerce.</p>
<h2 id=what-did-norman-washington-manley-do-for-jamaica>What did Norman Washington Manley do for Jamaica?</h2>
<p>The issue settled, Manley again went to the people. He lost the ensuing election to the JLP and gave his last years of service as Leader of the Opposition, establishing definitively the role of the Parliamentary Opposition in a developing nation.</p>
<h2 id=when-did-the-british-take-control-of-jamaica>When did the British take control of Jamaica?</h2>
<p>After the Spanish recognized British claims to Jamaica in the Treaty of Madrid (1670), British authorities began to suppress the buccaneers. In 1672 they arrested Henry Morgan following his successful (though unsanctioned) assault on Panama.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-jamaica-influence-music-around-the-world>How did Jamaica influence music around the world?</h2>
<p>Despite being such a small country, Jamaica has had an incredible influence on music around the world. Jamaica is the birthplace of many significant genres and artistic innovations; if you’ve ever enjoyed reggae, ska, or dancehall music, you can thank the musical talents of “the Rock” (as the country is commonly known).</p>
