<h2 id=how-orangutans-are-affected-by-deforestation>How orangutans are affected by deforestation?</h2>
<p>The scale of the deforestation had a severe impact on the population of the island’s orangutans, the largest arboreal animal. “The decline in population density was most severe in areas that were deforested or transformed for industrial agriculture, as orangutans struggle to live outside forest areas,” Voigt said.</p>
<h2 id=why-is-deforestation-a-threat-to-orangutans>Why is deforestation a threat to orangutans?</h2>
<p>The most important risk factor for orangutans is the loss of habitat. The creation of ‘forest islands’: these are areas of land too small to support an orangutan population and result in animals caught on these islands starving to death or turning to desperate food-seeking measures. …</p>
<h2 id=how-does-the-loss-of-the-trees-would-affect-the-food-web-that-orangutans-belong-to>How does the loss of the trees would affect the food web that orangutans belong to?</h2>
<p>Orangutans are criticality in danger and are losing their habitat because the trees in the rainforest where they live are being cut down. How would the loss of the trees would affect the food web that orangutans belong to. The fruit the orangutans eats is grown on the trees that are cut down.</p>
<h2 id=how-many-orangutans-are-killed-by-deforestation>How many orangutans are killed by deforestation?</h2>
<p>In the last 20 years, over 3.5 million hectares of Indonesian and Malaysian forest have been destroyed to make way for palm oil. Almost 80% of orangutan habitat has disappeared in the last 20 years. We are losing over 6,000 orangutans a year.</p>
<h2 id=does-nutella-kill-orangutans>Does Nutella kill orangutans?</h2>
<p>An important ingredient of Nutella is palm oil. Your Nutella Is Killing Orangutans. Your favourite Italian chocolate-hazelnut spread is suspected to be responsible for the endangerment of Borneo Orangutan monkeys.</p>
<h2 id=why-do-humans-chop-down-the-forest-orangutans-live-in>Why do humans chop down the forest orangutans live in?</h2>
<p>Poachers are also killing orangutans for food for the so-called bush meat trade. “Hundreds of loggers are employed to cut down a particular area of forest, and they have to find food for themselves,” says the Conservancy.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-killing-the-orangutans>What is killing the orangutans?</h2>
<p>More than 100,000 Critically Endangered orangutans have been killed in Borneo since 1999, research has revealed. Scientists who carried out a 16-year survey on the island described the figure as “mind-boggling”. Deforestation, driven by logging, oil palm, mining and paper mills, continues to be the main culprit.</p>
<h2 id=how-are-trees-affected-by-human-activities>How are trees affected by human activities?</h2>
<p>Such activities as commercial and artisanal logging, large scale land conversion, fuelwood and charcoal production, slash and burn agriculture, harvesting of non-timber forest products, hunting and mining all affect forest biodiversity.</p>
<h2 id=has-anyone-been-killed-by-an-orangutan>Has anyone been killed by an orangutan?</h2>
<p>A loud rumble, a scuffle and 33 long minutes of coordinated attacks by a female orangutan and her male partner led to the death of an older female orangutan in a Borneo forest, in what scientists say is the first incident of lethal aggression among orangutans ever observed by researchers.</p>
<h2 id=why-does-nutella-kill-monkeys>Why does Nutella kill monkeys?</h2>
<p>Your Nutella Is Killing Orangutans. Your favourite Italian chocolate-hazelnut spread is suspected to be responsible for the endangerment of Borneo Orangutan monkeys. Royal blasted Italian company Ferrero, producer of Nutella, for its use of palm oil – a key ingredient in Nutella – saying it leads to deforestation.</p>
<h2 id=why-is-nutella-bad-for-monkeys>Why is Nutella bad for monkeys?</h2>
<p>Palm oil contributes to deforestation in Borneo and Sumatra, the only two places on Earth where orangutans live. Trees are cut down for Palm Oil Plantations, but these trees are the Orangutan’s home. Nutella contains Palm Oil, by eating this product we are contributuing to hurting the Orangutan species.</p>
<h2 id=how-are-orangutans-threatened-by-the-cutting-down-of-trees>How are orangutans threatened by the cutting down of trees?</h2>
<p>Dear EarthTalk: Aren’t orangutans seriously threatened by the cutting down of forests? Deforestation is indeed the primary threat to the orangutan, a species of great ape known for its keen intelligence and the fact that it’s the largest animal to live primarily in trees.</p>
<h2 id=how-does-palm-oil-affect-the-orangutans-habitat>How does palm oil affect the orangutans habitat?</h2>
<p>As more palm oil plantations are planted, more tropical forests are cut down, leading to permanent deforestation in many cases, and reduces the necessary habitat for many endangered species, including orangutans [3].</p>
<h2 id=how-does-cutting-down-trees-affect-the-environment>How does cutting down trees affect the environment?</h2>
<p>Removing trees deprives the forest of portions of its canopy, which blocks the sun’s rays during the day and retains heat at night. That disruption leads to more extreme temperature swings that can be harmful to plants and animals. Yet the effects of deforestation reach much farther.</p>
<h2 id=can-a-orangutan-survive-without-a-forest>Can a orangutan survive without a forest?</h2>
<p>Without forests, orangutans cannot survive in the wild. Although our work at OFI focuses on the orangutan and the conservation of this amazing animal, the results and benefits extend far beyond the orange great ape. Orangutans are a charismatic great ape, which attracts global attention and concern.</p>
