<h2 id=when-did-the-inuit-settle-in-north-america>When did the Inuit settle in North America?</h2>
<p>The ancestors of the present-day Inuit, who are culturally related to Inupiat (northern Alaska), Katladlit (Greenland) and Yuit (Siberia and western Alaska), arrived about 1050 CE.</p>
<h2 id=did-the-inuit-live-in-north-america>Did the Inuit live in North America?</h2>
<p>The Inuit are indigenous people who live in the Arctic and subarctic regions of North America (parts of Alaska, Canada, and Greenland).</p>
<h2 id=where-did-the-inuit-tribe-settle>Where did the Inuit tribe settle?</h2>
<p>In Canada, early Inuit settled as far east and south as the Strait of Belle Isle on the coast of Newfoundland. As they moved, our early ancestors established villages and hunting territory. Like their ancestors to the west they were able to utilize the resources of the coast as well as those further inland.</p>
<h2 id=where-did-the-inuit-people-come-from-and-where-did-they-live>Where did the Inuit people come from and where did they live?</h2>
<p>Inuit language became distinct and, over a period of several centuries, its speakers migrated across northern Alaska, through Canada and into Greenland.</p>
<h2 id=where-did-the-vikings-make-contact-with-the-inuit>Where did the Vikings make contact with the Inuit?</h2>
<p>Their first European contact was with the Vikings who settled in Greenland and explored the eastern Canadian coast. The sagas recorded meeting skrælingar, probably an undifferentiated label for all the indigenous peoples whom the Norse encountered, whether Tuniit, Inuit, or Beothuk.</p>
<h2 id=who-was-the-first-person-to-settle-in-the-arctic>Who was the first person to settle in the Arctic?</h2>
<p>Modern-day Canadian Inuit pictured in their traditional boats (umiak), used for hunting and transportation. A new study, published in Science, shows that the first people to populate the Arctic regions of North America and Greenland were a group who moved into the area from Siberia around 3,000 B.C.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-the-inuit-people-survive-in-the-tundra>How did the Inuit people survive in the tundra?</h2>
<p>The traditional lifestyle of the Inuit is adapted to extreme climatic conditions; their essential skills for survival are hunting and trapping. Agriculture was never possible in the millions of square kilometres of tundra and icy coasts from Siberia to Northern America including Greenland.</p>
