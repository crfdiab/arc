<h2 id=how-much-rain-does-the-savanna-get-each-month>How much rain does the savanna get each month?</h2>
<p>Nearly all of the precipitation in the African Savanna occurs during the wet season. During the wet season, which stretches from May to November, the savanna receives a total of around 100 inches of rain or about 20 inches per month (254 cm per dry season and 50.8 per month).</p>
<h2 id=is-the-savanna-rainy>Is the savanna rainy?</h2>
<p>In general, savannas grow in tropical regions 8° to 20° from the Equator. Conditions are warm to hot in all seasons, but significant rainfall occurs for only a few months each year—about October to March in the Southern Hemisphere and April to September in the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<h2 id=how-much-sunlight-does-the-savanna-get>How much sunlight does the savanna get?</h2>
<p>Since tropical savannas are so close to the equator, plants receive 10 to 12 hours of sunlight during most days of the year. Another term for tropical savanna is “grassland,” which is largely due to the amount of perennial grasses in this biome.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-temperature-like-in-the-savanna>What is the temperature like in the savanna?</h2>
<p>68° to 86°F<br>
WEATHER: An important factor in the savanna is climate. The climate is usually warm and temperatures range from 68° to 86°F (20 to 30°C). Savannas exist in areas where there is a 6 – 8 month wet summer season, and a 4 – 6 month dry winter season. The annual rainfall is from 10 – 30 inches (25 – 75 cm) per year.</p>
<h2 id=how-much-rain-does-a-savanna-get-in-a-year>How much rain does a savanna get in a year?</h2>
<p>The average rainfall per year in the average savanna is 100 to 150cm of rain and in most savannas, during Dercember, January, and February (the dry months) there is hardly ANY rainfall. Dry season (winter months): During these months, many plants and grasses shrivel up and die and all local rivers may dry up…</p>
<h2 id=what-happens-to-the-savannah-during-the-dry-season>What happens to the Savannah during the dry season?</h2>
<p>During the dry season, the grasses and other plants of the savanna begin to brown and die. Image by tommorphy. If you traveled to the savanna in the wet summer season, you would have a very different experience than someone who had only visited in the dry winter season.</p>
<h2 id=how-much-rain-does-the-llanos-savanna-get>How much rain does the Llanos savanna get?</h2>
<p>However, in the Llanos Savanna, the river floods every year to enrich the land with nutrients. The average rainfall per year in the average savanna is 100 to 150cm of rain and in most savannas, during Dercember, January, and February (the dry months) there is hardly ANY rainfall.</p>
<h2 id=how-are-climatic-savannas-defined-by-the-climate>How are climatic savannas defined by the climate?</h2>
<p>Climatic savannas are defined strictly by the climate. Certain trees cannot survive because of the long dry seasons. Edaphic savannas are defined more by the soil type. These savannas are typically smaller and can be found in any warm climate.</p>
