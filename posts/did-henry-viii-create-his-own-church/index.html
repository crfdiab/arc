<h2 id=did-henry-viii-create-his-own-church>Did Henry VIII create his own church?</h2>
<p>On 3 November 1534 King Henry VIII became the Head of the newly founded Church of England. At the time this was a seismic shift in the power dynamics of Europe, as England’s split from Rome was confirmed.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-church-created-by-henry-viii>What was the church created by Henry VIII?</h2>
<p>the Church of England<br>
By 1536, Henry had broken with Rome, seized assets of the Catholic Church in England and Wales and declared the Church of England as the established church with himself as its head. Pope Paul III excommunicated Henry in 1538 over his divorce from Catherine of Aragon.</p>
<h2 id=what-big-change-in-religion-did-henry-viii-create>What big change in religion did Henry VIII create?</h2>
<p>Henry VIII fundamentally changed the nature of religion in England by breaking free of the Catholic Church. This established the groundwork for England to become a Protestant country.</p>
<h2 id=why-did-king-henry-viii-establish-the-church-of-england>Why did King Henry VIII establish the Church of England?</h2>
<p>Henry VIII started the process of creating the Church of England after his split with the Pope in the 1530s. Henry was anxious to ensure a male heir after his first wife, Catherine of Aragon, had borne him only a daughter. He wanted his marriage annulled in order to remarry.</p>
<h2 id=why-was-henry-viii-mad-at-the-church>Why was Henry VIII mad at the church?</h2>
<p>The Roman Catholic Church simply did not allow it. This put Henry VIII in a difficult position. The pope refused to grant Henry this and by 1533 his anger was such that he ordered the Archbishop of Canterbury to grant him a divorce so that he could marry Anne Boleyn.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-impact-of-henry-viii>What was the impact of Henry VIII?</h2>
<p>Henry VIII used Parliament to pass his laws, which helped to establish the authority of Parliament. The power of the gentry rose, and the power of the nobles declined. Although Henry VIII remained a Catholic, the break with Rome eventually turned England into a Protestant country. Henry built more warships.</p>
<h2 id=why-did-henry-viii-kill-thomas-more>Why did Henry VIII kill Thomas More?</h2>
<p>More also opposed Henry VIII’s separation from the Catholic Church, refusing to acknowledge Henry as supreme head of the Church of England and the annulment of his marriage to Catherine of Aragon. After refusing to take the Oath of Supremacy, he was convicted of treason and executed.</p>
<h2 id=why-did-henry-make-himself-head-of-church>Why did Henry make himself head of church?</h2>
<p>The pope refused to grant Henry this and by 1533 his anger was such that he ordered the Archbishop of Canterbury to grant him a divorce so that he could marry Anne Boleyn. Henry placed himself as head of the church and in that sense, in his eyes, his divorce was perfectly legal.</p>
<h2 id=what-did-the-pope-do-to-henry>What did the Pope do to Henry?</h2>
<p>In March 1534 the Pope eventually made his decision. He announced that Henry’s marriage to Anne Boleyn was invalid. Henry reacted by declaring that the Pope no longer had authority in England. In November 1534, Parliament passed an act that stated that Henry VIII was now the Head of the Church of England.</p>
<h2 id=who-was-the-protestant-king-of-england-in-1534>Who was the Protestant King of England in 1534?</h2>
<p>The Act of Supremacy in 1534 confirmed England’s break from the Roman Catholic Church and declared Henry VIII the supreme head of the English church. Henry married Anne Boleyn who was a protestant. Cromwell and Cranmer were also protestants.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-name-of-henrys-only-surviving-child>What was the name of Henry’s only surviving child?</h2>
<p>Henry and Catherine only surviving child was a girl (Mary I), Henry wanted a son to succeed him on the thrown and Catherine was unable to give him anymore children.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-the-reformation-affect-the-anglican-church>How did the Reformation affect the Anglican Church?</h2>
<p>Eventually, this act resulted in the creation of the Anglican Church, which adopted some of the changes of other Protestant reformers but remained very close to traditional Catholic doctrine and ritual. Use your textbook as a resource as well.</p>
