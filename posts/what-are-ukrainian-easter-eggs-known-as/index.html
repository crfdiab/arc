<p>A pysanka (plural: pysanky) is a Ukrainian Easter egg, decorated using beeswax and dyes. The word comes from the verb pysaty, “to write”, as the designs are not painted on, but written with beeswax.</p>
<h2 id=why-do-ukrainians-decorate-eggs>Why do Ukrainians decorate eggs?</h2>
<p>The tradition is called pysanky — the beautiful painted Easter eggs that were originally created to bless every part of life in Ukraine as talismans of prosperity, fertility, healing and protection, long life and bounty.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-very-first-easter-eggs-colour>What was the very first Easter eggs Colour?</h2>
<p>According to many sources, the Christian custom of Easter eggs was adopted from Persian tradition into the early Christians of Mesopotamia, who stained them with red colouring “in memory of the blood of Christ, shed at His crucifixion”.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-a-polish-egg>What is a Polish egg?</h2>
<p>Polish pisanka (plural pisanki) or jaja wielkanocne (Easter eggs); piski, kraszonki is a common name for an egg (usually that of a chicken, although goose or duck eggs are also used) richly ornamented using various techniques. There are various types of pisanki, based on the technique and preparation used.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-name-of-the-jeweler-who-decorated-the-most-beautiful-easter-eggs-in-the-world>What is the name of the jeweler who decorated the most beautiful Easter eggs in the world?</h2>
<p>Carl Fabergé<br>
Easter is the time for eggs and no one has made any more beautiful than Fabergé, the legendary Russian jeweller. Carl Fabergé created only 50 lavishly decorated eggs that the Russian Royal family gave as extravagant Easter gifts.</p>
<h2 id=how-do-you-make-ukrainian-easter-eggs-for-kids>How do you make Ukrainian Easter eggs for kids?</h2>
<p>Basic Directions for Decorating Ukrainian Easter Eggs with Kids. Using a clean white egg, draw the design you wish to create in pencil on your egg. Warm the Kitska in the candle and scoop a bit of natural beeswax into the reservoir. Steadily draw with wax onto the egg on all the parts that you would like to keep white.</p>
<h2 id=can-you-eat-pysanky-eggs>Can you eat pysanky eggs?</h2>
<p>The eggs are covered with hand-drawn designs — some are religious motifs and some are patterns from nature — that range from simple to painstakingly intricate. Making pysanky involves a multi-layered wax and dye process (think batik) that results in non-edible Easter eggs that you can keep forever.</p>
<h2 id=what-do-easter-eggs-have-to-do-with-jesus>What do Easter eggs have to do with Jesus?</h2>
<p>The egg, an ancient symbol of new life, has been associated with pagan festivals celebrating spring. From a Christian perspective, Easter eggs are said to represent Jesus’ emergence from the tomb and resurrection.</p>
<h2 id=why-is-dying-easter-eggs-a-tradition>Why is dying Easter eggs a tradition?</h2>
<p>For Christians, the Easter egg is symbolic of the resurrection of Jesus Christ. Painting Easter eggs is an especially beloved tradition in the Orthodox and Eastern Catholic churches where the eggs are dyed red to represent the blood of Jesus Christ that was shed on the cross.</p>
<h2 id=what-do-the-colors-of-the-ukrainian-easter-egg-mean>What do the colors of the Ukrainian easter egg mean?</h2>
<p>The blue color stands for the sky, air, and health. Given that the Ukrainians work hard on the land, shades of brown are identified with black soil, labor, and fertility. The brown color also embodies life-giving power. The black color is the color of night, everything unknown and mysterious.</p>
<h2 id=where-are-the-pysanky-eggs-found-in-ukraine>Where are the pysanky eggs found in Ukraine?</h2>
<p>No actual pysanky have been found from Ukraine’s prehistoric periods, as eggshells do not preserve well. Cultic ceramic eggs have been discovered in excavations near the village of Luka Vrublivets’ka, during excavations of a Trypillian site (5th to 3rd millennium BC).</p>
