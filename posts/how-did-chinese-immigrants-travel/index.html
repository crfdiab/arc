<p>Therefore, many Chinese immigrated to the US from Canton after news of the gold discovery in California. Immigrants undertook a Pacific Ocean journey of three weeks by ship. Many passengers could barely afford steerage class travel. Most had to borrow money from their relatives and neighbors.</p>
<h2 id=what-port-did-chinese-immigrants-use>What port did Chinese immigrants use?</h2>
<p>The new Immigration Station opened on January 21, 1910 and became the major port of entry to the U.S. for Asians and other immigrants coming from the west. The Immigration Station opened for partial operation on the northern neck of the island, later called China Cove.</p>
<h2 id=why-did-chinese-immigrants-work-on-the-railroad>Why did Chinese immigrants work on the railroad?</h2>
<p>Like thousands of native-born Americans and immigrants from other parts of the world, they hoped to strike it rich during the Gold Rush. When they failed to achieve this dream and the scramble for gold had ended, many of these Chinese immigrants remained in California to perform other jobs.</p>

<p>For more information, please see the full notice. In the 1850s, Chinese workers migrated to the United States, first to work in the gold mines, but also to take agricultural jobs, and factory work, especially in the garment industry.</p>
<h2 id=what-did-chinese-immigrants-do-in-the-gold-rush>What did Chinese immigrants do in the Gold Rush?</h2>
<p>The California Gold Rush of 1848 would change this, prompting the first major wave of Chinese Immigration into the state. These immigrants called the mountains of California Gam Saan which means ‘Gold Mountain.’ Chinese immigrants in California often lived in small groups. These groups were known to work the claims that other miners had abandoned.</p>
<h2 id=why-was-chinese-immigration-restricted-in-1882-writing>Why was Chinese immigration restricted in 1882 writing?</h2>
<p>In 1882, Congress passed the Chinese Exclusion Act, which, per the terms of the Angell Treaty, suspended the immigration of Chinese laborers (skilled or unskilled) for a period of 10 years.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-first-period-of-chinese-immigration>What was the first period of Chinese immigration?</h2>
<p>The first period began shortly after the California Gold Rush and ended abruptly with the passage of the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882. During this period thousands of Chinese, mostly young male peasants, left their villages in the rural countries to become laborers in the American West.</p>
