<h2 id=why-did-the-springbok-tour-protest-happen>Why did the Springbok tour protest happen?</h2>
<p>The South African Apartheid that had been in policy in South Africa was a cause of the protests against the Springbok tour in New Zealand in the 1980s. This Apartheid segregated races into whites and blacks. Segregation meant that key players like George Nepia, a Maori man, were left behind.</p>
<h2 id=why-was-the-1973-springbok-tour-cancelled>Why was the 1973 Springbok tour Cancelled?</h2>
<p>Page 4 – Stopping the 1973 tour With a Springbok tour to New Zealand scheduled for 1973, the issue was to become increasingly politicised. ‘ As if to warn him of the potential for civil unrest, a grandstand at Papakura was burnt down on 9 April 1973. Kirk’s mind had already been made up.</p>

<h2 id=12-september-third-test-auckland-what-happened-during-the-1981-springbok-tour-protests>12 September, third test, Auckland. What happened during the 1981 Springbok tour protests?</h2>
<p>For 56 days in July, August and September 1981, New Zealanders were divided against each other in the largest civil disturbance seen since the 1951 waterfront dispute. More than 150,000 people took part in over 200 demonstrations in 28 centres, and 1500 were charged with offences stemming from these protests.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-background-to-the-1981-springbok-tour>What was the background to the 1981 Springbok tour?</h2>
<p>The context of the 1981 Springbok Tour was the political climate at the time, specifically, that the legal status of citizens in South African was determined by their race. This was the era known as Apartheid, and it was how South African society was organised from 1948 until the end of the regime in 1991.</p>
<h2 id=how-many-times-have-south-africa-beaten-new-zealand-in-rugby>How many times have South Africa beaten New Zealand in rugby?</h2>
<p>Up until the start of the professional era, South Africa had won 21 tests to New Zealand’s 18….Records.</p>

<p>Minister Norman Kirk<br>
10 April 1973 Prime Minister Norman Kirk informed the New Zealand Rugby Football Union (NZRFU) that the government saw ‘no alternative’ to a ‘postponement’ of the planned tour by the South African Springboks.</p>

<h2 id=what-did-the-gleneagles-agreement-state>What did the Gleneagles Agreement State?</h2>
<p>In the Gleneagles Agreement, in 1977, Commonwealth Presidents and Prime Ministers agreed, as part of their support for the international campaign against apartheid, to discourage contact and competition between their sportsmen and sporting organisations, teams or individuals from South Africa.</p>
<h2 id=which-team-has-beaten-new-zealand-the-most>Which team has beaten New Zealand the most?</h2>
<p>Many national rugby union teams have suffered their heaviest defeats when playing against New Zealand, these being Argentina (91–8), Fiji (91–0), France (62–13), Ireland (60–0), Japan (145–17), Portugal (108–13), Samoa (101–14), South Africa (57–0), and Tonga (102–0).</p>
<h2 id=why-was-the-springbok-tour-of-new-zealand-cancelled>Why was the Springbok tour of New Zealand cancelled?</h2>
<p>Though they were officially welcomed by the New Zealand government, there was a sense of dread and anticipation that surrounded their arrival – perhaps, some thought, the 1981 tour should have been cancelled like the tour in 1972 was. The government officials could not anticipate, however, that the country was about to fall into “near-civil war.”</p>
<h2 id=when-did-new-zealand-rugby-team-tour-south-africa>When did New Zealand rugby team tour South Africa?</h2>
<p>No official rugby tour by any New Zealand rugby team to South Africa or South African rugby tour of New Zealand took place until after the collapse of apartheid in South Africa in the 1990s but, by that stage, a generation of New Zealanders had grown up without the cult of rugby being shoved down their throats.</p>
<h2 id=why-was-there-no-rugby-in-new-zealand-in-1981>Why was there no rugby in New Zealand in 1981?</h2>
<p>This lack of interest in the Rugby World Cup is not only due to the inability of thousands of working class New Zealanders to attend rugby matches but the fundamental change in attitude towards the national game that resulted from the 1981 Springbok Tour.</p>
<h2 id=why-did-the-springbok-set-fire-to-rugby-park>Why did the Springbok set fire to Rugby Park?</h2>
<p>On the 13th of August, Protesters set fire to the Christchurch rugby park grandstand because the activist group had suspected that the Springboks were training on the rugby grounds. This made government officials enraged at how critical the situation was and that anti-tour protest were getting too out of hand.</p>
