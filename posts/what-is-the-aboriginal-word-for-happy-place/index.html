<h2 id=what-is-the-aboriginal-word-for-happy-place>What is the Aboriginal word for happy place?</h2>
<p>Cooinda<br>
Cooinda is an aboriginal word meaning ‘Happy Place’ and that’s what owners Jonathan and Kerrie want their guests to feel during their stay.</p>
<h2 id=what-does-migaloo-mean-in-aboriginal>What does migaloo mean in Aboriginal?</h2>
<p>a white person<br>
The word migaloo – “a white person” – comes from Biri and other northern Queensland languages, where it originally meant “a ghost, a spirit”; many Australians are familiar with this word as a name for the albino humpback whale that migrates along the east coast of Australia.</p>
<h2 id=why-did-the-congress-of-aboriginal-people-change-their-name>Why did the Congress of Aboriginal people change their name?</h2>
<p>In 2016 the Congress of Aboriginal People changed their name to the Indigenous Peoples’ Assembly of Canada in part because the term is “more inclusive since it identifies peoples in similar circumstances in all countries with a colonial history.” If playback doesn’t begin shortly, try restarting your device.</p>
<h2 id=which-is-the-correct-term-for-aboriginal-people>Which is the correct term for Aboriginal people?</h2>
<p>But many Aboriginal people dislike being referred to as Indigenous. One Aboriginal woman with extensive experience in the education sector says that “the preferred term is definitely not Indigenous. The term ‘Indigenous’ and using the acronym ATSI can be offensive.”</p>
<h2 id=when-did-they-start-using-the-term-indigenous>When did they start using the term indigenous?</h2>
<p>The word “Indian” continued to be used in the Constitution Act 1982 and is used in many federal statutes to this day. The term Indigenous was chosen by Indigenous leaders in the 1970s to identify and unite diverse communities and represent them in global political arenas.</p>
<h2 id=are-there-any-aboriginal-words-in-the-english-language>Are there any Aboriginal words in the English language?</h2>
<p>Second only to the original language of Sydney Cove, Noongar has given more words to the English language than any other Indigenous Australian language. — Alan Dench, Professor of Linguistics, University of Western Australia [9] The most fearful cry Aboriginal people in north-west NSW could hear in the 1850s was ‘Gubbamen’ or ‘Gubba Man’ [10].</p>
