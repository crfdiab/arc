<h2 id=how-big-is-a-black-hole-in-km>How big is a black hole in KM?</h2>
<p>The central object is the black hole’s shadow, which is about five times larger than the black hole itself. The black hole is six and a half billion times the mass of the Sun and 38 billion km (24 billion miles) across.</p>
<h2 id=which-black-hole-is-1000-light-years-away>Which black hole is 1000 light years away?</h2>
<p>HR 6819<br>
But, scientists from NASA have found a new black hole named HR 6819, which is newly discovered. It is 1000 light-years away from earth.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-1000-light-years-away>What is 1000 light years away?</h2>
<p>Called HR 6819, the newly-discovered black hole is a triple system which can be seen from Earth’s southern hemisphere with the naked eye, in the constellation Telescopium.</p>
<h2 id=how-long-will-the-black-hole-reach-earth>How long will the black hole reach Earth?</h2>
<p>about 1,500 light-years<br>
A small black hole orbits with a red giant star about 1,500 light-years from Earth, and the tug of the black hole on the star revealed the invisible object to astronomers.</p>
<h2 id=how-heavy-is-a-black-hole-in-kg>How heavy is a black hole in KG?</h2>
<p>This is a very large number, about 2 x 10^30 kilograms. That’s 2 with 30 zeroes after it, or written out: 2,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000. This is about one million times more than the mass of the Earth. A stellar black hole forms when a massive star undergoes an explosive death called a supernova.</p>
<h2 id=whats-inside-a-black-hole>What’s inside a black hole?</h2>
<p>HOST PADI BOYD: While they may seem like a hole in the sky because they don’t produce light, a black hole is not empty, It’s actually a lot of matter condensed into a single point. This point is known as a singularity.</p>
<h2 id=how-many-light-years-do-black-holes-travel>How many light years do black holes travel?</h2>
<p>230 million light-years<br>
The fast-moving black hole, which is about 3 million times heavier than the sun, is traveling at 110,000 mph about 230 million light-years from Earth, according to researchers at the Center for Astrophysics, Harvard and Smithsonian.</p>
<h2 id=how-is-the-earth-far-away-from-a-black-hole>How is the Earth far away from a black hole?</h2>
<p>Originally thought to be 1600 light years away from Earth, it’s now thought to be 24000 light years away from Earth. This comes out to roughly 1.5 billion times the distance from the Earth to the Sun, or 22,300,000,000,000,000 miles. This is pretty far away. Black holes “suck things in” by gravitational force.</p>
<h2 id=how-long-does-it-take-for-a-black-hole-to-form>How long does it take for a black hole to form?</h2>
<p>It can take less than a billion years for one to reach a very large size, but it is unknown how long it takes them to form, generally. Scientists obtained the first image of a black hole, seen here, using Event Horizon Telescope observations of the center of the galaxy M87.</p>
<h2 id=what-happens-if-you-get-into-the-event-horizon-of-a-black-hole>What happens if you get into the event horizon of a black hole?</h2>
<p>If you got into the event horizon, your perception of space and time would entirely change. At the same time, the immense gravity of the black hole would compress you horizontally and stretch you vertically like a noodle, which is why scientists call this phenomenon (no joke) “spaghettification.”</p>
<h2 id=how-long-does-it-take-light-to-travel-4-billion-miles>How long does it take light to travel 4 billion miles?</h2>
<p>Divide both sides by miles leaves you with. which is almost 6 hours. So it takes almost 6 hours to travel that distance. In a vacuum, light travels at 186,282 miles per second. Divide 4 billion (4,000,000,000) by 186,282 and you get 21,473 seconds (to the nearest second) or 5 hours, 57 minutes and 53 seconds.</p>
