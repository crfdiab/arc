<p>the Alps<br>
For over 2,000 years, historians have argued over the route used by the Carthaginian general Hannibal to guide his army — 30,000 soldiers, 37 elephants and 15,000 horses — over the Alps and into Italy in just 16 days, conducting a military ambush against the Romans that was unprecedented in the history of warfare.</p>
<h2 id=what-mountains-did-hannibal-have-to-cross-when-he-invaded-the-italian-peninsula>What mountains did Hannibal have to cross when he invaded the Italian peninsula?</h2>
<p>Their commander Hannibal marched his troops, including cavalry and African war elephants, across a high pass in the Alps to strike at Rome itself from the north of the Italian peninsula. It was one of the greatest military feats in history.</p>
<h2 id=what-mountains-were-hannibal-crossed-when-attacking-rome>What mountains were Hannibal crossed when attacking Rome?</h2>
<p>Hannibal, one of history’s most famous generals, achieved what the Romans thought to be impossible. With a vast army of 30,000 troops, 15,000 horses and 37 war elephants, he crossed the mighty Alps in only 16 days to launch an attack on Rome from the north.</p>
<h2 id=why-didnt-hannibal-march-on-rome>Why didnt Hannibal march on Rome?</h2>
<p>As a result, Hannibal fought no more major battles in Italy for the rest of the war. It is believed that his refusal to bring the war to Rome itself was due to a lack of commitment from Carthage of men, money, and material — principally siege equipment.</p>

<p>When you’re not freezing where you stand, you’re hearing and seeing ghosts; worried that a band of barbarous, war mongering Gauls — eager to plunge their swords into any chest that wanders onto their lands — will appear from the rocks and force you into battle. Battle has been your reality many times on your journey from Spain to Italy.</p>
<h2 id=when-did-hannibal-barca-bring-his-army-to-rome>When did Hannibal Barca bring his army to Rome?</h2>
<p>Hannibal Barca of Carthage had brought this army to the banks of the Ebro in a fateful year, 218 bc. Ten years earlier, the Senate and people of Rome had forbidden the Carthaginians to cross that river on pain of war. Now nothing could please Hannibal more.</p>
<h2 id=where-was-hannibal-not-in-possession-of-the-peninsula>Where was Hannibal not in possession of the peninsula?</h2>
<p>Catalonia and Saguntum were now the only areas of the peninsula not in Hannibal’s possession. 214 BC wan the worst war. Hannibal was informed of Roman politics, and saw that this was the opportune time to attack. He had Gallic spies in every corner of the Roman Republic, even within the inner circles of the Senate itself.</p>
