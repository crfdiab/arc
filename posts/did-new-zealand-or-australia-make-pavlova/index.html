<h2 id=did-new-zealand-or-australia-make-pavlova>Did New Zealand or Australia make pavlova?</h2>
<p>Like many in the industry, Gilmore had long believed the pavlova to be an Australian creation, only recently discovering New Zealand also makes the same claim. The dessert was named after the Russian ballerina Anna Pavlova, who was a megastar when she toured both countries in the 1920s.</p>

<p>On the Australia side, chef Herbert “Bert” Sachse is said to have created the pavlova at Perth’s Esplanade Hotel in 1935, and it was named by the house manager, Harry Nairn, who remarked it was “as light as pavlova”.</p>
<h2 id=is-pavlova-the-national-dish-of-new-zealand>Is pavlova the national dish of New Zealand?</h2>
<p>Pavlova is considered to be New Zealand’s national dish. It is, in fact, a sweet dessert made of a meringue base topped with whipped cream and slices of fresh fruit. It is believed to be named in honor of the Russian ballerina Anna Pavlova who visited the country in the 1920s.</p>

<p>Kiwis claim that, in 1926, a Wellington hotel chef created the Pavlova in her honour, citing the dancer’s tutu as inspiration for the white meringue and cream combination. The Aussies have another take on it. They reckon Bert Sachse, a chef in Perth, Western Australia, created the dessert but his recipe is believed to date from around 1935.</p>

<p>‘The idea that it was invented in New Zealand or even Australia is a total fiction, as is the notion that the first pavlova desserts are of Antipodean origin,’ Mr Wood, who is from New Zealand, said.</p>

<p>For years the debate about its origin has been seen across the ditch. The popular dessert was named after the Russian ballerina, Anna Pavlova, on one of her tours to Australia and New Zealand in the 1920s, but it isn’t as simple as that.</p>

<p>Read more about sharing. The Oxford English Dictionary may have settled a long-running argument between Australia and New Zealand over who invented the pavlova. The dessert – meringue with fruit and cream – was named after the Russian ballerina Anna Pavlova, who visited both countries in the 1920s.</p>
