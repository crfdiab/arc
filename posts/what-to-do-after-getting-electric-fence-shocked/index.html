<h2 id=what-to-do-after-getting-electric-fence-shocked>What to do after getting electric fence shocked?</h2>
<p>If you’ve been shocked</p>
<ol>
<li>Let go of the electric source as soon as you can.</li>
<li>If you can, call 911 or local emergency services. If you can’t, yell for someone else around you to call.</li>
<li>Don’t move, unless you need to move away from the electric source.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id=can-a-shock-from-an-electric-fence-kill-you>Can a shock from an electric fence kill you?</h2>
<p>No, an electric fence is not dangerous. The voltage being sent through the wires is high, but the current or amplification (amps) is very low. A 220-volt shock will hurt just as much as a 10,000-volt shock, as long as the current or amps are the same.</p>
<h2 id=is-touching-an-electric-fence-dangerous>Is touching an electric fence dangerous?</h2>
<p>Many people wonder if they will get hurt by touching an electric horse fence. RAMM’s fence chargers are low-amperage and high-voltage, which produces a shock that is not harmful to humans or animals. People with heart conditions, children, or elderly should avoid touching electric fences.</p>
<h2 id=how-high-should-electric-fence-be-for-cattle>How high should electric fence be for cattle?</h2>
<p>For cattle-handling enclosures, use wood fencing or heavy wire panel fences. For these fences, electric lines are not appropriate. To prevent escapes, these fences should be at least 60 inches high and provide good visibility to the outside, which will reduce stress on the cattle and keep them moving.</p>
<h2 id=which-organ-is-mainly-affected-by-electric-shock>Which organ is mainly affected by electric shock?</h2>
<p>Electric injury can also affect the central nervous system. When a shock occurs, the victim may be dazed or may experience amnesia, seizure or respiratory arrest. Long-term damage to the nerves and the brain will depend on the extent of the injuries and may develop up to several months after the shock.</p>
<h2 id=can-an-electric-fence-kill-a-baby>Can an electric fence kill a baby?</h2>
<p>Because electric fencing has low current and pulsates, it can’t kill or permanently hurt anyone. However it is strongly advised to keep children away from an Electric Fence.</p>
<h2 id=can-an-electric-fence-kill-a-dog>Can an electric fence kill a dog?</h2>
<p>Can an electric fence hurt a dog? Yes, because of the electrical charge passing through the wires, your dog will experience short-term pain. However, the pain isn’t immense, so it shouldn’t kill a dog. Still, you have to watch out for potential burns and aggression.</p>
<h2 id=will-you-get-shocked-if-you-pee-on-an-electric-fence>Will you get shocked if you pee on an electric fence?</h2>
<p>“MythBusters” also found that peeing on an electric fence can be a shocking experience. Because the fence is higher off the ground than a train track is, urine won’t have time to separate into droplets, and the current can travel up the stream.</p>
<h2 id=can-an-electric-fence-kill-a-cat>Can an electric fence kill a cat?</h2>
<p>No, in general, an electric fence shouldn’t kill a cat. A cat who did come into contact with an electric fence could get fracked and then die of a heart attack. If the amperage were strong enough, then they could potentially even be fried.</p>
<h2 id=how-many-volts-will-kill-a-dog>How many volts will kill a dog?</h2>
<p>These electrified metal surfaces can have up to 100 volts of electricity, which is equivalent to the voltage in a light socket and more than enough to kill a dog.</p>
<h2 id=what-happens-when-you-ground-an-electric-fence>What happens when you ground an electric fence?</h2>
<p>The charge continues through the earth and to the grounding rod. Then, it goes up the ground wire and travels to the grounding terminal of the charger. If the fence is not working properly, the animal will not be able to feel a shock.</p>
<h2 id=can-you-protect-your-feet-from-an-electric-shock>Can you protect your feet from an electric shock?</h2>
<p>Suffice it to say, normal footwear is not enough to guarantee protection against electric shock from a power system. Research conducted on contact resistance between parts of the human body and points of contact (such as the ground) shows a wide range of figures (see the end of the chapter for information on the source of this data):</p>
<h2 id=can-a-person-receive-a-shock-from-an-electric-shock>Can a person receive a shock from an electric shock?</h2>
<p>Since there can be no voltage between electrically common points, there will be no voltage applied across the person contacting the lower wire, and they will not receive a shock.</p>
<h2 id=why-does-my-electric-fence-not-work-properly>Why does my electric fence not work properly?</h2>
<p>Significant amounts of rain or snow can all affect the ability of the fence to work properly. In a properly working fence, an animal will feel a bit of an electric current as the charge passes through the animal’s body.</p>
