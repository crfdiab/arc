<h2 id=are-gravel-pits-bad-for-the-environment>Are gravel pits bad for the environment?</h2>
<p>The most common impacts of gravel pit development and operations are the lack of conservation of reclamation materials, erosion, dust and noise nuisances, impacts to road condition, negative visual aesthetics and water and soil contamination.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-the-environmental-impacts-of-aggregate-mines>What are the environmental impacts of aggregate mines?</h2>
<p>1.3 Environmental Impacts of Aggregate Resource Mining Of particular concern are the noise, dust, water contamination, soil contamination, traffic, negative impacts on road conditions, and negative visual aesthetics associated with their development.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-the-harmful-effects-of-gravel>What are the harmful effects of gravel?</h2>
<p>These higher concentrations may have very negative effects on plants and animals in the area and cause diseases such as brain and kidney damage, lung irritation, cardiac abnormality and event death to plants and animals.</p>
<h2 id=how-does-a-quarry-negatively-affect-the-environment>How does a quarry negatively affect the environment?</h2>
<p>The most obvious engineering impact of quarrying is a change in geomorphology and conversion of land use, with the associated change in visual scene. This major impact may be accompa- nied by loss of habitat, noise, dust, vibrations, chemical spills, erosion, sedimentation, and dereliction of the mined site.</p>
<h2 id=what-happens-to-old-gravel-pits>What happens to old gravel pits?</h2>
<p>What happens to old gravel pits? Pits and quarries disrupt the existing movement of surface water and groundwater; they interrupt natural water recharge and can lead to reduced quantity and quality of drinking water for residents and wildlife near or downstream from a quarry site.</p>
<h2 id=how-does-the-extraction-of-water-impact-the-environment>How does the extraction of water impact the environment?</h2>
<p>Some human activities, such as pumping water into the ground for oil and gas extraction, can cause an aquifer to hold too much ground water. Too much ground water discharge to streams can lead to erosion and alter the balance of aquatic plant and animal species.</p>
<h2 id=how-does-the-use-of-plastics-effects-of-environment>How does the use of plastics effects of environment?</h2>
<p>The major impact of plastic bags on the environment is that it takes many years to for them to decompose. In addition, toxic substances are released into the soil when plastic bags perish under sunlight and, if plastic bags are burned, they release a toxic substance into the air causing ambient air pollution.</p>
<h2 id=is-living-near-a-quarry-safe>Is living near a quarry safe?</h2>
<p>If the quarries are located in places where there is a living population, people living in the area will also be exposed to dust. Specific reported adverse health effects by people who reside nearby quarry sites include nasal infection, cough, and asthma [13,16].</p>
<h2 id=how-can-we-reduce-the-environmental-impact-of-quarrying>How can we reduce the environmental impact of quarrying?</h2>
<p>To reduce lasting visual pollution, landscaping and tree planting could take place when the quarry is exhausted. Screens could also be set up around working quarries. Restrictions on the size of quarries and working hours could cut down on visual and noise pollution.</p>
<h2 id=is-it-dangerous-to-live-near-a-quarry>Is it dangerous to live near a quarry?</h2>
<h2 id=what-are-the-advantages-and-disadvantages-of-quarrying>What are the advantages and disadvantages of quarrying?</h2>
<p>Quarrying</p>
<table><tr><th>Advantages</th><th>Disadvantages</th></tr><tr><td>Provides employment</td><td>Regular blasting produces excessive noise and dust</td></tr><tr><td>Supports the local economy</td><td>Dust and extra vehicle pollution can lead to increased numbers of respiratory conditions, eg asthma</td></tr><tr><td>Better local road system</td><td>Increase in traffic, eg transport lorries</td></tr></table>
<h2 id=why-are-gravel-pits-a-problem-in-alberta>Why are gravel pits a problem in Alberta?</h2>
<p>Despite the obvious value aggregate extraction brings to Alberta, it has also emerged as an area of potential conflict at the community level. Municipalities and their residents often have concerns with the visual, environmental and economic impacts of sand and gravel operations within their boundaries.</p>
<h2 id=how-is-sand-and-gravel-mining-affecting-the-environment>How is sand and gravel mining affecting the environment?</h2>
<p>Sand and gravel mining has been one of the serious environmental problems around the globe in recent years. Much work has been carried out to access the environmental impacts of sand and gravel in Nzhelele Valley, Limpopo Province, South Africa , where there is an increase in demand for sand and gravel for construction purposes.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-the-impacts-of-quarries-and-gravel-pits>What are the impacts of quarries and gravel pits?</h2>
<p>Water level Significant decline in aquifer water levels due to quarry dewatering and rock removal. Kraemer Quarry Turbidity and well construction No impacts observed. Water level Significant decline in aquifer water levels due to quarry dewatering and rock removal. Golberg Quarry Turbidity and well construction No impacts observed.</p>
<h2 id=what-do-you-need-to-know-about-gravel-pits>What do you need to know about gravel pits?</h2>
<p>– The removal of sand, gravel, and rock for aggregates, which includes drilling, blasting, and breaking necessary for extraction and transport. Extraction does not include any crushing, screening or similar activities carried out to make the gravel marketable. Gravel</p>
