<h2 id=what-was-the-purpose-of-selective-service-act>What was the purpose of Selective Service Act?</h2>
<p>On May 18, 1917, Congress passed the Selective Service Act, which authorized the Federal Government to temporarily expand the military through conscription. The act eventually required all men between the ages of 21 to 45 to register for military service.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-purpose-of-the-selective-service-act-quizlet>What was the purpose of the Selective Service Act quizlet?</h2>
<p>In May 1917, Congress passed the Selective Service Act, which created a national draft. The act required all men ages 21 to 30 to register for military service at local polling stations. This was the first time the U.S. government had established a draft before entering a war.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-purpose-of-the-selective-service-and-how-did-it-work>What was the purpose of the Selective Service and how did it work?</h2>
<p>Overview. If Congress and the President were to reinstate a military draft, the Selective Service System would conduct a National Draft Lottery to determine the order in which young men would be drafted. The lottery would establish the priority of call based on the birth dates of registrants.</p>
<h2 id=does-the-selective-service-act-still-exist>Does the Selective Service Act still exist?</h2>
<p>Eight states (California, Connecticut, Indiana, Nebraska, Oregon, Vermont, Washington, and Wyoming) have no such requirements, though Indiana does give men 18–25 the option of registering with Selective Service when obtaining a driver’s license or an identification card.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-effect-of-the-selective-service-act>What was the effect of the Selective Service Act?</h2>
<p>The Selective Service Act, signed by Pres. Woodrow Wilson on May 18, 1917, created the Selective Service System, which managed the induction of some 2.8 million men into the armed forces over the next two years and abolished the much maligned bounty system.</p>

<h2 id=which-of-the-following-is-a-result-of-the-selective-service-act>Which of the following is a result of the selective service act?</h2>
<p>Woodrow Wilson, in turn introduced in 1917, the selective service act which 2.8 million men were inducted within the Army during the course of 2 years and thereby abolishing the bounty system.</p>
<h2 id=why-was-the-selective-service-act-of-1917-so-successful>Why was the Selective Service Act of 1917 so successful?</h2>
<p>Due to the effort to incite a patriotic attitude, the World War I draft had a high success rate, with fewer than 350,000 men “dodging” the draft. Young men at the first national registration day held in association with the Selective Service Act of 1917.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-difference-between-the-civil-war-and-the-selective-service>What was the difference between the Civil War and the Selective Service?</h2>
<p>Young men at the first national registration day held in association with the Selective Service Act of 1917. The biggest difference between the draft established by the Selective Service Act of 1917 and the Civil War draft was that substitutes were not allowed.</p>
<h2 id=when-did-the-selective-service-act-of-1950-expire>When did the Selective Service Act of 1950 expire?</h2>
<p>The act was scheduled to expire in June 1950, but the outbreak of the Korean War that month prompted Congress to extend it for another year. The Selective Service Act was reauthorized in 1951 as the Universal Military Training and Service Act, and all males age 18 to 26 were required to register for the draft.</p>
<h2 id=how-many-people-volunteered-for-the-selective-service-act>How many people volunteered for the Selective Service Act?</h2>
<p>While President Wilson at first wished to use only volunteer troops, it soon became clear that this would be impossible. When war was declared, Wilson asked for the Army to increase to a force of one million. But by six weeks after war was declared, only 73,000 men had volunteered for service.</p>
