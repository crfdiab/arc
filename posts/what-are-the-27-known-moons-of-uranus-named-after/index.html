<h2 id=what-are-the-27-known-moons-of-uranus-named-after>What are the 27 known moons of Uranus named after?</h2>
<p>To date 27 moons have been discovered around Uranus, those named after characters from Shakespeare include Titania (A Midsummer Night’s Dream), Oberon (A Midsummer Night’s Dream), Ariel (The Tempest), Miranda (The Tempest) and Puck (A Midsummer Night’s Dream).</p>
<h2 id=what-is-uranuss-biggest-moon>What is Uranus’s biggest moon?</h2>
<p>Titania<br>
Oberon and Titania are the largest Uranian moons, and were first to be discovered—by William Herschel in 1787. William Lassell, who had been first to see a moon orbiting Neptune, discovered the next two, Ariel and Umbriel.</p>
<h2 id=does-uranus-have-15-moons>Does Uranus have 15 moons?</h2>
<p>At the time when this image was collected, only five moons of Uranus were known. Voyager 2 discovered 10 more moons in 1986, bringing the total to 15. As of 2014, 27 moons are known to orbit Uranus.</p>
<h2 id=is-uranus-the-only-planet-with-27-moons>Is Uranus the only planet with 27 moons?</h2>
<p>Uranus has 27 known moons. While most of the satellites orbiting other planets take their names from Greek or Roman mythology, Uranus’ moons are unique in being named for characters from the works of William Shakespeare and Alexander Pope. All of Uranus’ inner moons appear to be roughly half water ice and half rock.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-neptunes-biggest-moon>What is Neptunes biggest moon?</h2>
<p>Triton<br>
Triton is the largest of Neptune’s 13 moons. It is unusual because it is the only large moon in our solar system that orbits in the opposite direction of its planet’s rotation―a retrograde orbit.</p>
<h2 id=will-humans-ever-walk-on-uranus>Will humans ever walk on Uranus?</h2>
<p>The surface of Uranus and Neptune are gaseous and you can’t walk on them. And like the other gas giants – Jupiter and Saturn – pressure and density increases as you get closer to the core.</p>
<h2 id=can-we-live-on-titania>Can we live on Titania?</h2>
<p>As with Uranus’ other major moons, the current state of the icy mantle is unknown. However, if the ice contains enough ammonia or other antifreeze, Titania may have a liquid ocean layer at the core-mantle boundary. Naturally, it is unlikely that such an ocean could support life.</p>

<h2 id=what-are-neptunes-14-moons-called>What are Neptune’s 14 moons called?</h2>
<p>Each of the moons is named for a mythological Greek water deity. Moving from closest to Neptune to furthest out, their names are Naiad, Thalassa, Despina, Galatea, Larissa, S/2004 N1 (which has yet to receive an official name), Proteus, Triton, Nereid, Halimede, Sao, Laomedeia, Psamathe, and Neso.</p>
<h2 id=how-many-moons-does-uranus-have-in-the-solar-system>How many moons does Uranus have in the Solar System?</h2>
<p>Uranus, the seventh planet of the Solar System, has 27 known moons, all of which are named after characters from the works of William Shakespeare and Alexander Pope.</p>
<h2 id=are-there-any-moons-in-the-outer-solar-system>Are there any moons in the outer Solar System?</h2>
<p>In the outer solar system, the gas giants Jupiter and Saturn and the ice giants Uranus and Neptune have dozens of moons. As these planets grew in the early solar system, they were able to capture smaller objects with their large gravitational fields.</p>
<h2 id=who-was-the-first-person-to-discover-the-moons-of-uranus>Who was the first person to discover the moons of Uranus?</h2>
<p>William Herschel discovered the first two moons, Titania and Oberon, in 1787. The other three ellipsoidal moons were discovered in 1851 by William Lassell ( Ariel and Umbriel) and in 1948 by Gerard Kuiper ( Miranda ). These five have planetary mass, and so would be considered (dwarf) planets if they were in direct orbit about the Sun.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-distance-between-uranus-and-miranda>What is the distance between Uranus and Miranda?</h2>
<p>Another moon of Uranus that is interesting is Miranda. It was discovered on February 16, 1948, by Gerard P. Kuiper. Its distance from Uranus is 129,900 km or 80,716 miles and takes 1.413 Earth days to make 1 complete orbit around the planet.</p>
