<h2 id=is-wheat-made-in-the-uk>Is wheat made in the UK?</h2>
<p>UK total wheat production is estimated to be around 16.68 million tonnes for 2015, beating last year’s figure of 16.61 million tonnes. This is the first time ever wheat grown in the UK has exceeded 16 million tonnes two years running.</p>
<h2 id=how-much-wheat-does-uk-produce>How much wheat does UK produce?</h2>
<p>In 2019 the volume of wheat produced reached approximately 16.23 million tons. Additionally, the value of wheat production in the United Kingdom can be found at the following….Volume of harvested wheat production in the United Kingdom (UK) from 2003 to 2019 (in 1,000 tons)</p>
<table><tr><th>Characteristic</th><th>Volume in thousand tons</th></tr><tr><td>–</td><td>–</td></tr></table>
<h2 id=what-crops-does-the-uk-produce>What crops does the UK produce?</h2>
<p>Crops commonly grown in the United Kingdom include cereals, chiefly wheat, oats and barley; root vegetables, chiefly potatoes and sugar beet; pulse crops such as beans or peas; forage crops such as cabbages, vetches, rape and kale; fruit, particularly apples and pears; and hay for animal feed.</p>
<h2 id=is-the-uk-self-sufficient-in-wheat>Is the UK self sufficient in wheat?</h2>
<p>The UK is self-sufficient in barley and, on the whole, largely for rapeseed, although the ratio for rapeseed has dropped in recent years (Figure 5). UK self-sufficiency in wheat has also declined recently, a result of lower domestic supplies.</p>
<h2 id=why-does-the-uk-import-wheat>Why does the UK import wheat?</h2>
<p>Why import wheat? The average UK harvest is around 15 million tonnes of wheat, so there is enough quantity to meet the UK milling industries tonnage requirement. However, it is not all of the quality required by millers, and as such some wheat is imported.</p>

<h2 id=how-much-wheat-is-produced-in-the-uk>How much wheat is produced in the UK?</h2>
<p>UK wheat and barley production. This publication gives the first estimate of the quantity of wheat and barley produced in the UK from the 2020 harvest.</p>
<h2 id=when-do-uk-wheat-and-barley-statistics-come-out>When do UK wheat and barley statistics come out?</h2>
<p>This publication gives the first estimate of the quantity of wheat and barley produced in the UK from the 2020 harvest. Full UK provisional results including yield and area data for wheat and barley, along with results for the remaining cereal and oilseed rape crops will be included in the release that is published on Thursday 8 October 2020.</p>
<h2 id=where-does-the-flour-in-the-uk-come-from>Where does the flour in the UK come from?</h2>
<p>In order to maintain steady supplies of flour, millers need a steady supply of sustainable and affordable wheat. Having access to suitable homegrown grain is paramount. Most of the wheat that UK flour millers use is grown in the UK – in a typical year around 85% is homegrown.</p>
<h2 id=which-is-the-third-largest-wheat-producer-in-the-eu>Which is the third largest wheat producer in the EU?</h2>
<p>The UK is the third largest wheat producer in the European Union (EU) ( figure 3) and the fourth largest in rapeseed output ( figure 4 ). The UK’s five-year average wheat yield of 7.61 tons/hectare (T/Ha) is among the EU’s highest.</p>
