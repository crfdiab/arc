<h2 id=who-was-the-declaration-of-independence-written-against>Who was the Declaration of Independence written against?</h2>
<p>On July 4, 1776, representatives from the original 13 American Colonies came together to formally adopt a document that listed all their grievances against the British government and announce their independence from the crown. This document became known as the Declaration of Independence.</p>
<h2 id=who-was-the-declaration-of-independence-meant-for>Who was the Declaration of Independence meant for?</h2>
<p>The Declaration of Independence was designed for multiple audiences: the King, the colonists, and the world. It was also designed to multitask. Its goals were to rally the troops, win foreign allies, and to announce the creation of a new country.</p>
<h2 id=what-group-oppose-the-declaration-of-independence>What group oppose the Declaration of Independence?</h2>
<p>Which of the following groups opposed the Declaration of Independence? Patriots. Loyalists. Sons of Liberty.</p>
<h2 id=who-are-the-patriots-in-the-declaration-of-independence>Who are the Patriots in the declaration of Independence?</h2>
<p>Patriots are defined as colonists who rebelled against the British rule. The Patriots are the colonists I described above, the ones that had an iffy relationship with the British. They didn’t like all the ridiculous taxes and acts the British imposed on them. They didn’t like the ways that the British soldiers had treated the colonists.</p>
<h2 id=why-did-the-colonists-complain-about-the-declaration-of-independence>Why did the colonists complain about the declaration of Independence?</h2>
<p>This was due to things such as the murder/mistreatment of colonists by British soldiers and taxation without representation. The colonists had 27 total complaints, all of which were documented in the Declaration of Independence.</p>
<h2 id=who-was-responsible-for-the-declaration-of-independence>Who was responsible for the declaration of Independence?</h2>
<p>They are the ones responsible for the Declaration of Independence. A Patriot would’ve viewed the Declaration of Independence as empowering. It probably would’ve felt great to tell King George off, and in a classy way.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-the-shortcomings-of-the-declaration-of-independence>What are the shortcomings of the declaration of Independence?</h2>
<p>We can embrace the underlying spirit of the Declaration of Independence but also learn from its shortcomings. It is painful to write about the shortcomings of the Declaration of Independence.</p>
