<h2 id=where-is-monferrato-in-italy>Where is Monferrato in Italy?</h2>
<p>Piedmont region<br>
Casale Monferrato (Italian pronunciation: [kaˈzaːle moɱferˈraːto]) is a town in the Piedmont region of Italy, in the province of Alessandria. It is situated about 60 km (37 mi) east of Turin on the right bank of the Po, where the river runs at the foot of the Montferrat hills….</p>

<h2 id=where-are-piedmont-wines-from>Where are Piedmont wines from?</h2>
<p>Italy<br>
Piemonte wine is the range of Italian wines made in the region of Piedmont in the northwestern corner of Italy. The best-known wines from the region include Barolo and Barbaresco. They are made from the Nebbiolo grape.</p>
<h2 id=where-are-barolo-wines-from>Where are Barolo wines from?</h2>
<p>northwestern Italy<br>
The scenic region sits in the foothills of the Alps in northwestern Italy; in fact, the mountainous soil that nurtures the vines of the Nebbiolo is what gives this wine its distinct characteristics. Known around the world as “the king of wines,” Barolo is a timeless wine with a history as rich as its nickname.</p>
<h2 id=what-region-is-barolo-in>What region is Barolo in?</h2>
<p>Piedmont<br>
The Barolo wine region is arguably the most famous DOCG in Italy. It’s located in the northern Italian region of Piedmont, south of Alba, and has UNESCO World Heritage status.</p>
<h2 id=where-is-monteferrato>Where is Monteferrato?</h2>
<p>Montferrat, Italian Monferrato, historic area of northwestern Italy covering most of the modern provinces of Alessandria and Asti in the Piedmont region.</p>
<h2 id=is-barolo-a-dry-wine>Is Barolo a dry wine?</h2>
<p>Simple modern wine investing Elegant and age-worthy, Barolo is Italy’s most sought after Nebbiolo wine. It’s a dry red wine with a dramatic history and is said to be the most powerful expression of the Nebbiolo grape!</p>
<h2 id=where-is-gavi-made>Where is Gavi made?</h2>
<p>The Gavi, (or Cortese di Gavi) DOCG is situated in the southern part of Piedmont, in northwestern Italy. The town of Gavi is at the centre of the production zone while Cortese is the indigenous white grape variety from which it is made.</p>
<h2 id=is-barolo-like-pinot-noir>Is Barolo like pinot noir?</h2>
<p>What Is It? Barolo is a red wine produced in the Piedmont region of Italy. Barolos are often compared to the great Pinot Noirs of Burgundy, due to their light brick-garnet pigments and bright acidity – plus the region it’s made has a lot that is aesthetically common to Burgundy too, but we’ll get to that later.</p>
<h2 id=is-barolo-an-appellation>Is Barolo an appellation?</h2>
<p>As with the rest of Italy, Barolo operates under the DOC/DOCG system. The appellation was elevated to DOCG status in 1980. After five years of aging, Barolo wines are permitted to be designated ‘Riserva. ‘ Barolo wines must have a minimum of 13% ABV, though many wines surpass this level.</p>
<h2 id=where-is-the-monferrato-wine-region-in-italy>Where is the Monferrato wine region in Italy?</h2>
<p>Monferrato Wine. The Monferrato area consists of a series of hills below the River Po in the south-east corner of Piedmont, in north-western Italy. Like Langhe, this zone received its own DOC in 1994 and follows similar relaxed rules allowing the blending of native varieties with international grapes.</p>
<h2 id=where-do-they-make-white-wine-in-italy>Where do they make white wine in Italy?</h2>
<p>This white wine is produced north of Venice in a region called Valdobbiadene and is made primarily from Glera grapes, though other grape varieties can be incorporated in a small percentage. The region’s cool climate near the Alps helps grow fresh and crisp white wines such as Soave, made from Gargenega grapes.</p>
<h2 id=where-is-the-barbera-del-monferrato-located>Where is the Barbera del Monferrato located?</h2>
<p>Barbera del Monferrato, its DOCG Superiore sibling, Nizza DOCG, Ruchè, Albugnano and Dolcetto di Ovado are also located here. In the far northeast of the DOC lies the sub appellation Monferrato Casalese, based around the commune of Casale. The wines tend to be a little less complex than others from the Piedmont region.</p>
<h2 id=what-kind-of-climate-is-the-alto-monferrato>What kind of climate is the Alto Monferrato?</h2>
<p>The northern part is known as Basso (Lower) Monferrato and features plains and rolling hills. South of the river lies the Alto Monferrato, which rises into the Apennine mountain chain. Much of the terroir here is ideal for viticulture, thanks to its continental climate and free draining, tuffaceous soils.</p>
