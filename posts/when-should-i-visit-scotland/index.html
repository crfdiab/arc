<h2 id=when-is-the-best-time-to-play-golf-in-scotland>When is the best time to play golf in Scotland?</h2>
<p>Scotland is a popular country to travel to for avid golfers. Anytime between April and September would be a good time for golf. However in April and May you’ll likely still see rain and wind, but almost no crowds. June, may be the best time for golfing due to weather.</p>
<h2 id=when-is-the-last-month-of-summer-in-scotland>When is the last month of summer in Scotland?</h2>
<p>August is the last month of summer in Scotland. I know it’s been short! Temperature averages will be much the same as July (including the levels of travelers coming here—brace yourself for higher wait times & crowds). The good news is it should be fairly sunny while you’re here.</p>
