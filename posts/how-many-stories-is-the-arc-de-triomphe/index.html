<h2 id=how-many-stories-is-the-arc-de-triomphe>How many stories is the Arc de Triomphe?</h2>
<p>The Arc de Triomphe is located on the right bank of the Seine at the centre of a dodecagonal configuration of twelve radiating avenues. It was commissioned in 1806 after the victory at Austerlitz by Emperor Napoleon at the peak of his fortunes.</p>
<h2 id=how-many-steps-would-you-have-to-climb-to-get-to-the-top-of-the-arc-de-triomphe>How many steps would you have to climb to get to the top of the Arc de Triomphe?</h2>
<p>284 steps<br>
You can visit the ground level of the arch for free. Take the underpass to access the arch. Never attempt to cross the chaotic and dangerous roundabout from the Champs Elysées! To access the top, you can climb 284 steps, or take an elevator to the mid-level and climb 64 stairs to the top.</p>
<h2 id=how-much-is-it-to-climb-the-arc-de-triomphe>How much is it to climb the Arc de Triomphe?</h2>
<p>The Arc is open daily from 10am closing at some point between 10pm and 11pm depending on the time of year. Adult admission is 12 Euros with under 18s free (2019 prices). Admission is also free for 18-25 years old if you are a citizen of one the countries of the EU or are a non-European permanent residents of France.</p>
<h2 id=how-long-is-the-arc-de-triomphe>How long is the Arc de Triomphe?</h2>
<p>164 feet<br>
Napoleon I commissioned the triumphal arch in 1806—after his great victory at the Battle of Austerlitz (1805)—to celebrate the military achievements of the French armies. The arch, designed by Jean-François-Thérèse Chalgrin, is 164 feet (50 metres) high and 148 feet (45 metres) wide.</p>
<h2 id=how-many-steps-are-in-the-arc-de-triomphe>How many steps are in the Arc de Triomphe?</h2>
<p>There are 284 steps, via a tiny spiral staircase that is completely enclosed. There are two such staircases, one to go up, and a completely separate one to come back down. There is an elevator that you can ask to use if you have a plausible reason for doing so. It is nominally reserved for disabled people, but enforcement of this policy is uneven.</p>
<h2 id=why-is-the-arc-de-triomphe-important-to-paris>Why is the Arc de Triomphe important to Paris?</h2>
<p>Owing to its significant place in the French capital’s history– evoking both triumphant and dark historical events– as well as to its iconic status, the Arc de Triomphe has an obvious place on any complete list of Paris’ top tourist attractions .</p>
<h2 id=how-old-do-you-have-to-be-to-go-up-the-arc-de-triomphe>How old do you have to be to go up the Arc de Triomphe?</h2>
<p>Tickets to climb or take the elevator up the arch are purchased at the ground level. Free entry for children under 18. The Paris Museum Pass includes admission to the Arc de Triomphe.</p>
<h2 id=what-kind-of-rock-is-the-arc-de-triomphe-made-of>What kind of rock is the Arc de Triomphe made of?</h2>
<p>The Arc de Triomphe is made of limestone. The entirety of the Arc de Triomphe is made from a sedimentary rock called limestone. As a product of thousands of years of weathering, limestone comes from the oceans. Once bones and shells accumulate on the ocean floor, the combination of calcium carbonate and mud builds up and hardens into limestone.</p>
