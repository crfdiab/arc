<h2 id=what-was-the-impact-of-louis-xiv-rule>What was the impact of Louis XIV rule?</h2>
<p>In that time, he transformed the monarchy, ushered in a golden age of art and literature, presided over a dazzling royal court at Versailles, annexed key territories and established his country as the dominant European power.</p>
<h2 id=what-were-2-things-louis-xiv-did-to-strengthen-his-rule>What were 2 things Louis XIV did to strengthen his rule?</h2>
<p>Louis XIV is significant for radicially altering the balance of power in French politics: centralizing power in the monarchy and establishing a system of patronage and despotism that survived until the French Revolution.</p>
<h2 id=who-was-louis-xiv-successor>Who was Louis XIV successor?</h2>
<p>Louis XV<br>
(After the death of Louis XIV, history repeated itself as his five-year-old great-grandson, Louis XV, succeeded him.)</p>
<h2 id=how-did-louis-xiv-strengthen-his-power>How did Louis XIV strengthen his power?</h2>
<p>Louis XIV strengthened the power of the monarchy by weakening the nobility, expanding the bureaucracy and army, and by creating new roles in the bureaucracy which allowed royal power to reach further into the provinces.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-the-reign-of-louis-xiv-impact-the-world>How did the reign of Louis XIV impact the world?</h2>
<p>Louis pioneered the centralized modern state, and the absolutist monarchy he created served as a model for virtually every other government in Europe. Louis XIV came to the throne while still a child in the wake of the Fronde, a destructive civil war that saw members of the French nobility ravaging the country over private feuds.</p>
<h2 id=what-did-louis-xiv-do-after-philip-iv-died>What did Louis XIV do after Philip IV died?</h2>
<p>After the death of Philip IV of Spain in 1665, Louis XIV initiated the War of Devolution (1667-1668) claiming Spanish Netherlands as his wife’s inheritance. The French armies easily defeated the Spanish forces conquering Spanish Netherlands and the Franche-Comté.</p>
<h2 id=when-did-louis-xiv-become-king-of-france>When did Louis XIV become king of France?</h2>
<p>Educators go through a rigorous application process, and every answer they submit is reviewed by our in-house editorial team. Louis XIV famously proclaimed, “I am the state.” He became king of France in the mid-1600s, the heyday of the doctrine of the “divine right of kings,” also known as monarchial absolutism.</p>
<h2 id=where-did-louis-xiv-move-his-french-court>Where did Louis XIV move his French court?</h2>
<p>To encapsulate French successes and riches, Louis expanded his father’s hunting cabin at Versailles into the Palace of Versailles, where Louis permanently relocated the French court in 1682.</p>
