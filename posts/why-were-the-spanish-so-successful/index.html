<h2 id=why-were-the-spanish-so-successful>Why were the Spanish so successful?</h2>
<p>The first and primary reason was wealth and power. They did not care too much for the people who were poor and those who gained the most fame were not what one would consider missionaries. Cortes conquered the Aztecs and in doing so secured himself a fortune.</p>
<h2 id=why-did-the-spanish-win-against-the-aztecs>Why did the Spanish win against the Aztecs?</h2>
<p>The Spanish tried to change the Aztecs into Catholics and make them act like Spanish people. They made it easier to change from Aztec rule to Spanish rule by letting many Aztec nobles become Spanish nobles. The conquistadors rewarded people who had helped them defeat the Aztecs.</p>
<h2 id=did-spain-win-the-spanish-war>Did Spain win the Spanish war?</h2>
<p>The war ended with the signing of the Treaty of Paris on December 10, 1898. As a result Spain lost its control over the remains of its overseas empire — Cuba, Puerto Rico, the Philippines Islands, Guam, and other islands.</p>
<h2 id=why-was-the-war-of-spanish-succession-important>Why was the war of Spanish Succession important?</h2>
<p>The question of Spanish succession at the turn of the 18th century was linked directly to the question of balance of powers in Europe, and led to a major European war that ended the European hegemony of France. In the late 1690s, the declining health of childless King Charles II of Spain deepened the ongoing dispute over his succession.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-spanish-advantage-in-the-new-world>What was the Spanish advantage in the New World?</h2>
<p>The greatest military advantage possessed by the Spanish, however, was the horse. Natives in the New World had no knowledge of these animals, to say anything of their use as a weapon of war.</p>
<h2 id=why-was-the-defeat-of-the-spanish-armada-so-important>Why was the defeat of the Spanish Armada so important?</h2>
<p>The defeat of the Spanish Armada in 1588 – a fleet of Spanish ships led by Spanish commander Medina Sidonia with the purpose of overthrowing Queen Elizabeth I – is considered one of England’s greatest military achievements, and one that served to boost the monarch’s popularity.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-the-spanish-gain-control-of-florida>How did the Spanish gain control of Florida?</h2>
<p>Once in the Azores, Spanish ships refitted and returned to Spain. Corsairs of Spain’s rivals quickly became aware of Spain’s richly laden galleons passing through the Florida Strait and moved to occupy the many hideouts in the Bahama Islands. From there they attacked Spanish ships as they toiled through the narrows to pick up the current.</p>
