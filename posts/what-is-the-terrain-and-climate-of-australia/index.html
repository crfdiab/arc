<h2 id=what-is-the-terrain-and-climate-of-australia>What is the terrain and climate of Australia?</h2>
<p>Although it is a large country, its topography is not too varied, and most of it consists of low desert plateau. The southeast, however, does have fertile plains. Australia’s climate is mostly arid to semiarid, but the south and east are temperate and the north is tropical.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-physical-environment-like-in-australia>What is the physical environment like in Australia?</h2>
<p>Australia is the driest inhabited continent on earth, with the least amount of water in rivers, the lowest run-off and the smallest area of permanent wetlands of all the continents. One third of the continent produces almost no run-off at all and Australia’s rainfall and stream-flow are the most variable in the world.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-australia-shaped-like>What is Australia shaped like?</h2>
<p>Although the shape of Australia is due largely to tectonic Earth movements and long term changes in sea level, most of its topography is a result of prolonged erosion by wind and water. After the ice melted, parts of the continent subsided and formed sedimentary basins such as the Eromanga Basin in South Australia.</p>
<h2 id=is-australia-mostly-a-desert>Is Australia mostly a desert?</h2>
<p>Apart from Antarctica, Australia is the driest continent in the world. About 35 per cent of the continent receives so little rain, it is effectively desert. The total desert area equates to 18 per cent of the total mainland area of Australia.</p>
<h2 id=which-is-the-best-description-of-the-terrain-in-australia>Which is the best description of the terrain in Australia?</h2>
<p>Terrain: mostly low plateau with deserts; fertile plain in southeast Definition: This entry contains a brief description of the topography. Source: CIA World Factbook – This page was last updated on January 20, 2018.</p>
<h2 id=what-kind-of-land-mass-does-australia-have>What kind of land mass does Australia have?</h2>
<p>As an island nation, coastlines play an important role in defining national, state and territory boundaries. Nearly 20 per cent of Australia’s land mass is classified as desert. As well as having a low average annual rainfall, rainfall across Australia is also variable.</p>
<h2 id=how-is-the-geography-of-australia-different-from-other-countries>How is the geography of Australia different from other countries?</h2>
<p>The geography of Australia encompasses a wide variety of biogeographic regions being the world’s smallest continent but the sixth-largest country in the world. The population of Australia is concentrated along the eastern and southeastern coasts. The geography of the continent is extremely diverse,…</p>
<h2 id=what-are-the-names-of-the-australian-territories>What are the names of the Australian territories?</h2>
<p>These territories are Australian Capital Territory, Northern Territory, and Norfolk Island. The rest of the territories are governed by the Commonwealth Law.</p>
