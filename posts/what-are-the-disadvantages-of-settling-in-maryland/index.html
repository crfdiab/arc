<h2 id=what-are-the-disadvantages-of-settling-in-maryland>What are the disadvantages of settling in Maryland?</h2>
<p>You’ll never find a place to live that is absolutely free from disadvantages — and Maryland is no exception.</p>
<ul>
<li>High Volume of Traffic. For every positive, there is also a negative.</li>
<li>Expensive Property Taxes. Relative to the rest of the country, Maryland does have high property taxes.</li>
<li>High Property Values.</li>
<li>Bay Bridge.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id=did-maryland-discourage-catholic-settlers>Did Maryland discourage Catholic settlers?</h2>
<p>The Protestant Revolution ended Maryland’s experiment with religious toleration. Religious laws were backed up with harsh sanctions. Maryland established the Church of England as its official church in 1702 and explicitly barred Catholics from voting in 1718.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-result-of-the-settlement-of-maryland>What was the result of the settlement of Maryland?</h2>
<p>The settlement of Maryland. In 1654, however, the so-called Toleration Act was repealed after Puritans seized control of the colony, leading to a brief civil war that ended with Lord Baltimore losing control of propriety rights over Maryland in March 1655.</p>
<h2 id=where-did-the-first-colonists-settle-in-maryland>Where did the first colonists settle in Maryland?</h2>
<p>The settlement of Maryland. The first colonists to Maryland arrive at St. Clement’s Island on Maryland’s western shore and found the settlement of St. Mary’s. In 1632, King Charles I of England granted a charter to George Calvert, the first Lord Baltimore, yielding him proprietary rights to a region east of the Potomac River in exchange…</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-religious-conflict-in-the-maryland-colony>What was the religious conflict in the Maryland colony?</h2>
<p>Religious conflict was strong in ensuing years as the American Puritans, growing more numerous in Maryland and supported by Puritans in England, set out to revoke the religious freedoms guaranteed in the founding of the colony. In 1649, Maryland Governor William Stone responded by passing an act ensuring religious liberty…</p>
<h2 id=when-did-the-calverts-regain-control-of-maryland>When did the Calverts regain control of Maryland?</h2>
<p>Although the Calverts later regained control of Maryland, anti-Catholic activity persisted until the 19th century, when many Catholic immigrants to America chose Baltimore as their home and helped enact laws to protect their free practice of religion.</p>
