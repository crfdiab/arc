<h2 id=how-did-the-aztec-people-feel-about-montezuma-ii>How did the Aztec people feel about Montezuma II?</h2>
<p>When Montezuma II was born (circa 1466), the Aztec empire spread to present-day Honduras and Nicaragua. The Aztec people, however, resented the emperor’s frequent demands for tribute and victims for religious sacrifice.</p>
<h2 id=what-did-montezuma-think-of-the-spanish>What did Montezuma think of the Spanish?</h2>
<p>Montezuma II, the Aztec emperor, professed a fear that the Spaniards were followers of the white-skinned and bearded Teotihuacán god, Quetzalcoatl, who had been exiled by the Toltecs because he forbade human sacrifice and had promised a return from across the sea to enforce his law.</p>

<p>Cortes sent Montezuma to the rooftop to speak with his people and plead for calm, but they were having none of it. Instead, they attacked Montezuma, hurling stones and spears and firing arrows at him. Montezuma was horribly injured before the Spanish could get him away. Montezuma died of his wounds a few days later, on June 29, 1520.</p>

<p>Ahuitzotl was an impressive ruler. During his time as emperor, he fought wars all over central America and doubled the size of the Aztec Empire. By the time Montezuma became the king, Aztec influence spread from Mexico into Nicaragua and Honduras.</p>
<h2 id=what-did-montezuma-i-do-for-a-living>What did Montezuma I do for a living?</h2>
<p>Montezuma was a wise ruler and a modest man. He lived in a simple, clean palace and had only a few wives. A great deal of his time was passed in conversation with sage friends, as well as with his half-brother, Tlacaelel, who acted as the “serpent woman” or chief military and political adviser to several Aztec rulers.</p>
<h2 id=where-was-the-city-of-montezuma-in-mexico>Where was the city of Montezuma in Mexico?</h2>
<p>It was located on an island in Lake Texcoco in the Valley of Mexico. Tenochtitlan was the forerunner of Mexico City, the capital of modern Mexico. Montezuma’s father, Huitzilhuitl (“Hummingbird Feather”), had many children; Montezuma was born about 1397, the son of a princess of Cuernavaca named Miahuaxihuitl.</p>
