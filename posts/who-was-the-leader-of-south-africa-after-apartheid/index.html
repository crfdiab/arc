<h2 id=who-was-the-leader-of-south-africa-after-apartheid>Who was the leader of South Africa after apartheid?</h2>
<p>Nelson Mandela The first post-apartheid president of South Africa.</p>
<h2 id=what-happened-before-apartheid-in-south-africa>What happened before apartheid in South Africa?</h2>
<p>In the prelude to the formal implementation of apartheid, the largest groups in South Africa redefined themselves. Black South Africans set aside ethnic divisions, forming national organizations to oppose oppression. Between union in 1910 and 1948, a variety of whites-only political parties governed South Africa.</p>
<h2 id=when-did-the-laws-of-apartheid-end-in-south-africa>When did the laws of apartheid End in South Africa?</h2>
<p>Despite strong and consistent opposition to apartheid within and outside of South Africa, its laws remained in effect for the better part of 50 years. In 1991, the government of President F.W. de Klerk began to repeal most of the legislation that provided the basis for apartheid.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-the-great-depression-lead-to-apartheid-in-south-africa>How did the Great Depression lead to apartheid in South Africa?</h2>
<p>The Great Depression and World War II brought increasing economic woes to South Africa, and convinced the government to strengthen its policies of racial segregation. In 1948, the Afrikaner National Party won the general election under the slogan “apartheid” (literally “apartness”).</p>
<h2 id=who-was-the-leader-of-the-anti-apartheid-movement>Who was the leader of the anti apartheid movement?</h2>
<p>By 1961, most resistance leaders had been captured and sentenced to long prison terms or executed. Nelson Mandela, a founder of Umkhonto we Sizwe (“Spear of the Nation”), the military wing of the ANC, was incarcerated from 1963 to 1990; his imprisonment would draw international attention and help garner support for the anti-apartheid cause.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-system-of-segregation-in-south-africa>What was the system of segregation in South Africa?</h2>
<p>For other uses, see Apartheid (disambiguation). Apartheid ( South African English : / əˈpɑːrteɪd /; Afrikaans: [aˈpartɦɛit], segregation; lit. “aparthood”) was a system of institutionalised racial segregation that existed in South Africa and South West Africa (now Namibia) from 1948 until the early 1990s.</p>
