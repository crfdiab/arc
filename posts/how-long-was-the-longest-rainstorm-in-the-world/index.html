<h2 id=how-long-was-the-longest-rainstorm-in-the-world>How long was the longest rainstorm in the world?</h2>
<p>Some 1.825 meters (71.8 inches) of rain fell over 24 hours, from January 7 to 8, 1966.</p>
<h2 id=how-long-did-the-longest-rainfall-last>How long did the longest rainfall last?</h2>
<p>Greatest rainfall in 24 hours The biggest rainfall in a day occurred with the passage of Cyclone Denise in Foc-Foc, La Réunion, an island in the southern Indian Ocean. Some 1.825 meters (71.8 inches) of rain fell over 24 hours, from January 7 to 8, 1966.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-world-record-for-the-longest-rain>What is the world record for the longest rain?</h2>
<p>According to the World Meteorological Organization, a record 1,825 mm (71.8 in) of rain fell in 24 hours at Foc-Foc (elevation: 2,990 m; 9,810 ft) on the French island territory of Réunion in the Indian Ocean on 7–8 January 1966. The event occurred during the passage of tropical cyclone Denise.</p>
<h2 id=what-if-it-stopped-raining-forever>What if it stopped raining forever?</h2>
<p>Rivers would dry up, crops would fail and our green and pleasant land would start to look pretty desperate. In fact after just a year without rain, desert conditions would start to occur. Land could be irrigated, but that would mean tapping precious underground reserves.</p>
<h2 id=where-was-the-longest-period-of-rain-ever-recorded>Where was the longest period of rain ever recorded?</h2>
<p>In the Lower 48, the longest stretch any location has seen measurable precipitation (rain/snow) is 79 days near Otis, Oregon, in the winter of 1997-98. Alaska’s record of 88 consecutive days with measurable precipitation was set in Ketchikan in 1920.</p>
<h2 id=which-is-the-longest-lasting-type-of-thunderstorm>Which is the longest lasting type of thunderstorm?</h2>
<p>Longest lasting thunderstorms. Share. Supercells are powerful thunderstorms which form around a mesocyclone, a deep, rotating updraft. At up to several kilometres across, they can last several hours, making them the longest-lasting and largest of all thunderstorms.</p>
<h2 id=when-did-it-rain-the-most-in-one-month>When did it rain the most in one month?</h2>
<p>That site set the monthly record with 107 inches of rain in March 1942. The annual rainfall record set there was 704.83 inches (58 feet) in 1982.</p>
<h2 id=where-did-it-rain-for-247-days-in-a-row>Where did it rain for 247 days in a row?</h2>
<p>The most recent entry on the top five list is Pali Golf Course on Oahu where 247 days in a row with measurable rain was recorded 1993-94. Another incredible rainfall record in Hawaii is a location on the Big Island that once saw 881 straight days with at least a trace of rain. A trace is a small quantity of precipitation that can’t be measured.</p>
