<h2 id=why-did-this-anger-the-american-colonists>Why did this anger the American colonists?</h2>
<p>This angered the colonists. They felt the Proclamation was a plot to keep them under the strict control of England and that the British only wanted them east of the mountains so they could keep an eye on them. As a result, colonists rebelled against this law just like they did with the mercantile laws.</p>
<h2 id=what-angered-the-american-colonists>What angered the American colonists?</h2>
<p>The Stamp Act, Sugar Act, Townshend Acts, and Intolerable Acts are four acts that contributed to the tension and unrest among colonists that ultimately led to The American Revolution.</p>
<h2 id=why-did-the-colonists-dislike-the-stamp-act>Why did the colonists dislike the Stamp Act?</h2>
<p>The Stamp Act of 1765 was abhorred by the colonists because it represented an effort by the British to use taxes in order to raise money, and not to regulate commerce as in the past.</p>
<h2 id=why-did-the-british-pass-the-stamp-act>Why did the British pass the Stamp Act?</h2>
<p>To get rid out of the economic situation they imposed a direct tax system via a new law, called ‘Stamp Act, 1765’ to the colonists of the 13 American colonies. The British government’s argument was, they had to fight the war so that they could protect the people living in the colonies from the French invasion.</p>
<h2 id=why-was-the-colonists-unhappy-with-the-british>Why was the colonists unhappy with the British?</h2>
<p>Colonists who had already settled on these lands were ordered to return east of the mountains. In 1765 Parliament passed the Quartering Act that said the colonists needed to find or pay for lodging for British soldiers stationed in America. With the French and Indian War over, many colonists saw no need for soldiers to be stationed in the colonies.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-the-colonists-pay-for-the-french-and-indian-war>How did the colonists pay for the French and Indian War?</h2>
<p>They decided to require several kinds of taxes from the colonists to help pay for the French and Indian War. These taxes included the Stamp Act, passed in 1765, which required the use of special paper bearing an embossed tax stamp for all legal documents. Other laws, such as the Townsend Acts, passed in.</p>
