<h2 id=are-most-desert-animals-nocturnal>Are most desert animals nocturnal?</h2>
<p>Almost all desert animals are smart enough to stay out of the sun during the hottest part of the day. They stay deep underground in burrows. When an animal is active at night and rests during the day, it is called nocturnal. There are a few animals that can be seen during the day.</p>
<h2 id=how-do-wildlife-live-in-the-desert>How do wildlife live in the desert?</h2>
<p>Most desert organisms are small mammals and reptiles, some of which dig underground burrows to escape from the scorching desert heat. Few large desert fauna can survive in the desert; those that do have special adaptations that allow them to withstand their inhospitable environment.</p>
<h2 id=is-there-wildlife-in-the-desert>Is there wildlife in the desert?</h2>
<p>When people think of a desert, often camels and rattle snakes spring to mind, however many more animals call desert home. Foxes, spiders, antelopes, elephants and lions are common desert species. Now for the cool animals; the Addax antelope found in the Sahara Desert is one of the most beautiful antelopes in the world.</p>
<h2 id=what-animals-are-active-at-night-in-the-desert>What animals are active at night in the desert?</h2>
<p>Coyotes, skunks, bobcats, tarantulas, scorpions, centipedes, peccaries, kangaroo rats, jack rabbits, owls and nightjars are just a few of the many animals you might be lucky enough to spot.</p>
<h2 id=why-is-the-desert-dangerous-at-night>Why is the desert dangerous at night?</h2>
<p>Wide and Fast Temperature Range Dangers Temperatures in arid areas may get as high as 55 degrees C (130 degrees F) during the day and as low as 10 degrees C (50 degrees F) during the night. The drop in temperature at night occurs rapidly and will chill a person who lacks warm clothing and is unable to move about.</p>
<h2 id=when-do-animals-become-active-in-the-desert>When do animals become active in the desert?</h2>
<p>Aestivation: when animals or other organisms become inactive during the summer season (like a summer hibernation). Crepuscular: being active or occurring at dawn or dusk. Diurnal: being active or occurring during the day. Migration: movement of an animal or a group of animals from one place to another. Nocturnal: active only at night.</p>
<h2 id=is-there-a-lot-of-wildlife-in-the-desert>Is there a lot of wildlife in the desert?</h2>
<p>Desert Wildlife Although at first glance the desert seems to have little in the way of wildlife, it actually contains large, diverse populations. The desert environment may seem an unlikely place for animals to thrive or even exist. However, desert animals have adapted to their environment, and each fills an important niche in the desert ecosystem.</p>
<h2 id=what-do-desert-animals-do-in-the-winter>What do desert animals do in the winter?</h2>
<p>However, when animals can’t migrate, there are other ways they can deal with desert extremes. In the winter, when it gets really cold, or in the summer, when it gets really hot, desert animals may be less active or inactive altogether. In winter, we call this hibernation, like when bears and other large mammals “sleep” for the winter.</p>
<h2 id=when-are-most-animals-active-during-the-day>When are most animals active during the day?</h2>
<p>Most animals that we see are diurnal, or active during the day, since that is when most humans are active. If an animal is mainly active at night, when the sun is down, we call them nocturnal. Other animals may be active either when the sun is coming up (dawn) or when the sun is going down (dusk).</p>
