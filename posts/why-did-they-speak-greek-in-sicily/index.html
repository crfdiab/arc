<h2 id=why-did-they-speak-greek-in-sicily>Why did they speak Greek in Sicily?</h2>
<p>At Crotone, Bova, and Gerace the clergy continued to use the Greek liturgy even though they were under Latin bishops. In Apulia, where the Normans took a less intense attitude to the Latinisation of the people, the Griko people continued to speak the Greek language and to celebrate the Byzantine rite.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-the-romans-first-come-into-contact-with-greek-culture>How did the Romans first come into contact with Greek culture?</h2>
<p>The Romans came into contact with Greek culture again during the conquest of Magna Graecia, Mainland Greece and the “Hellenistic countries” (countries that had been marked by Greek culture and language) in the 2nd and the 1st centuries BC. It was also a must to speak Greek as well as Latin.</p>

<p>8th century BC<br>
Somewhere around the 8th century BC, Greeks came in droves to settle Magna Graecia, bringing with them traces of a civilization that heavily influenced ancient Rome. While the cultural contribution of these Greeks to southern Italy is clear, researchers have argued for years about their biological contribution.</p>
<h2 id=is-sicily-italian-or-greek>Is Sicily Italian or Greek?</h2>
<p>Sicily, Italian Sicilia, island, southern Italy, the largest and one of the most densely populated islands in the Mediterranean Sea. Together with the Egadi, Lipari, Pelagie, and Panteleria islands, Sicily forms an autonomous region of Italy. It lies about 100 miles (160 km) northeast of Tunisia (northern Africa).</p>
<h2 id=why-was-sicily-taken-over-by-the-italians>Why was Sicily taken over by the Italians?</h2>
<p>Sicily has been an impoverished region since being robbed of its National Treasury in 1860 when it was occupied by the Italian Army. During the occupation, the factories of the region were disassembled and relocated to Northern Italy. Without a manufacturing base, the island was forced of olives,…</p>
<h2 id=when-was-southern-italy-colonized-by-the-greeks>When was southern Italy colonized by the Greeks?</h2>
<p>Southern Italians are closest to the Greeks (as the historical region of Magna Graecia, “Great Greece”, bears witness to), «Sicily and Southern Italy were heavily colonized by Greeks beginning in the eight to ninth century B.C..</p>
<h2 id=how-did-the-romans-influence-the-sicilian-sicels>How did the Romans influence the Sicilian Sicels?</h2>
<p>They also influenced the native peoples, especially the Sicilian Sicels, who became hellenised after they adopted the Greek culture as their own. The term Magna Graecia first appears in Polybius ‘ Histories. The Roman poet Ovid notably referred to the south of Italy as such in his poem Fasti .</p>
<h2 id=are-there-still-greek-people-in-southern-italy>Are there still Greek people in southern Italy?</h2>
<p>Although most of the Greek inhabitants of Southern Italy became de-hellenized and no longer spoke Greek, remarkably a small Griko -speaking minority still exists today in Calabria and mostly in Salento. Griko is the name of a language combining ancient Doric, Byzantine Greek, and Italian elements, spoken by people in the Magna Graecia region.</p>
