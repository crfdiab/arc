<h2 id=is-japan-safe-for-women>Is Japan safe for women?</h2>
<p>Japan even has a variety of women-only options for transportation and activities, so you can have peace of mind when out and about. Japanese people, including Japanese women, are comfortable traveling, eating out, and doing what they like by themselves, so don’t be afraid to make the most of this culture of …</p>
<h2 id=is-there-gender-equality-in-japan>Is there gender equality in Japan?</h2>
<p>The Gender Inequality Index (GII) has Japan ranked as 19th out of 188 countries in 2019. The GII measures three things: reproductive health, empowerment and the labor market. For this index, where 0 represents full equality and 1 is total inequality, Japan places at 0.116.</p>
<h2 id=which-country-is-safest-for-women>Which country is safest for women?</h2>
<p>Here are the top 10 safest places for women to travel alone.</p>
<ul>
<li>Finland. Land of the midnight sun and the Northern Lights, Finland is the ideal destination for nature lovers.</li>
<li>Canada.</li>
<li>New Zealand.</li>
<li>Uruguay.</li>
<li>Switzerland.</li>
<li>Belgium.</li>
<li>Austria.</li>
<li>Iceland.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id=what-is-the-crime-rate-in-japan-2020>What is the crime rate in Japan 2020?</h2>
<p>Number of murder cases in Japan in 2020, by region The police in Japan’s Kanto region recorded 288 murder cases in 2020. The Kanto region was followed by the Kinki region with more than 190 recorded murder cases. The total number of murder cases in Japan amounted to 929 in 2020.</p>
<h2 id=how-are-women-treated-in-business-in-japan>How are women treated in business in Japan?</h2>
<p>Many Japanese businessmen are uncomfortable doing business with women (especially foreign women in senior positions), and may seem nervous or rude. While this is gradually changing, women should not expect to be treated exactly the same as their male co-workers.</p>
<h2 id=do-you-think-japan-is-safe-for-women>Do you think Japan is safe for women?</h2>
<p>Thus I don’t think Japan is as safe as the image propagated about the country suggests. It seems that just about every foreign woman I know has a terrible story to tell. I have no way of knowing if this number is as high for Japanese women, because only foreign women shared their stories with me.</p>
<h2 id=where-does-japan-stand-in-its-approach-to-women-rights>Where does Japan stand in its approach to women rights?</h2>
<p>Japanese women, non-binary folks, and men are increasingly bringing national attention to issues usually not talked about. A culture of silence characterizes Japan on many fronts, yet women and their supporters are rejecting that narrative by speaking out about sexual offenses and other gender-based harassment.</p>
<h2 id=how-does-it-feel-to-be-a-foreign-woman-in-japan>How does it feel to be a foreign woman in Japan?</h2>
<p>As a minority in Japan, foreign women do receive a lot of male attention and are often offered work as hostesses. They also complain to me about how they feel objectified in Japan. White models and mannequins are seen everywhere, even though white women represent a tiny percentage of the population.</p>
