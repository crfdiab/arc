<li>upper indus plain.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id=what-are-the-physical-features-of-northern-mountains-of-pakistan>What are the physical features of northern mountains of Pakistan?</h2>
<p>The northern highlands include parts of the Hindu Kush, the Karakoram Range, and the Himalayas. This area includes such famous peaks as K2 (Mount Godwin Austen, at 8,611 meters the second highest peak in the world), and Nanga Parbat (8,126 meters), the twelfth highest.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-the-physical-features-of-northern-mountains>What are the physical features of northern mountains?</h2>
<p>Comparison between Northern and Western Mountains Northern mountains: are at high range at the altitude of average six thousand meters. They are covered with mass of rock and ice, which forms glacier on these mountains. The area is rich in water as the ice melts the small tributaries of water comes out of it.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-importance-of-northern-mountains-of-pakistan>What is the importance of northern mountains of Pakistan?</h2>
<p>The northern mountain barrier influences the precipitation pattern in Pakistan by intercepting monsoon (rain-bearing) winds from the south. Melting snow and glacial meltwater from the mountains also feed the rivers, including the Indus, which emerge from the east-west-aligned ranges to flow southward.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-the-drainage-features-of-western-mountains-of-pakistan>What are the drainage features of western mountains of Pakistan?</h2>
<p>Answer: Drainage of Northern and North Western Mountains: Drainage of Northern and North Western Mountains Fast flowing rivers Rapids/ water falls Khunjrab River – flows south along the Karakoram Highway from the Khunjrab Valley and is known as the Nagar River , Hunza River south of Sust .</p>
<h2 id=why-northern-mountains-are-important-for-pakistan>Why northern mountains are important for Pakistan?</h2>
<h2 id=what-are-the-common-features-to-the-northern-mountains-of-pakistan>What are the common features to the northern mountains of Pakistan?</h2>
<p>Physical features of the Northern Mountains Karakoram means black gravel, it is a mass or rock and ice. these mountains extend from Hunza to the Shyok River. The average height of these mountains is 6000 Km, the second highest peak of the world is located here. These mountains also have glaciers and huge ice mountains.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-the-importance-of-northern-mountains>What are the importance of northern mountains?</h2>
<p>The importance of Northern mountains in India are given below : It is the most prominent source for Glacial rivers – enough rainfall and vast snow-fields in these mountains are the source of perennial rivers. The melting of the snow provides enough water during the season.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-difference-between-potohar-plateau-and-balochistan>What is difference between potohar plateau and Balochistan?</h2>
<p>Answer: Balochistan plateau is consisted next to plains and mountains where as the Potwar plateau has many broken grounds where on earth there are many ups and downs on the ground, so potwar plateau has the size to drain the water easily.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-geography-and-drainage-of-pakistan>What is the geography and drainage of Pakistan?</h2>
<p>Topography and Drainage. Pakistan is divided into three major geographic areas: the northern highlands; the Indus River plain, with two major subdivisions corresponding roughly to the provinces of Punjab and Sindh; and the Balochistan Plateau.</p>
<h2 id=where-are-the-fast-flowing-rivers-in-pakistan>Where are the fast flowing rivers in Pakistan?</h2>
<p>Drainage of Northern and North Western Mountains Fast flowing rivers Rapids/ water falls Khunjrab River – flows south along the Karakoram Highway from the Khunjrab Valley and is known as the Nagar River , Hunza River south of Sust .</p>
<h2 id=where-are-the-northern-highlands-of-pakistan-located>Where are the northern highlands of Pakistan located?</h2>
<p>Roughly, then, the northern highlands are north of the imaginary east-west line; the Balochistan Plateau is to the west of the imaginary southwest line; and the Indus Plain lies to the east of that line. The northern highlands include parts of the Hindu Kush, the Karakoram Range, and the Himalayas.</p>
<h2 id=where-is-the-most-fertile-soil-in-pakistan>Where is the most fertile soil in Pakistan?</h2>
<p>Cultivation is sparse in the northern mountains, the southern deserts, and the western plateaus, but the Indus River basin in Punjab and northern Sindh has fertile soil that enables Pakistan to feed its population under usual climatic conditions.</p>
