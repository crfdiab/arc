<h2 id=why-are-there-so-many-different-types-of-plants-in-australia>Why are there so many different types of plants in Australia?</h2>
<p>Australia has a huge diversity of plants (27 700 plant species according to the last studies), due to the fact that the country is huge and the climate is different from one region to another.</p>
<h2 id=how-is-the-flora-of-australia-compared-to-the-usa>How is the flora of Australia compared to the USA?</h2>
<p>The statistics are very much slanted towards the vascular plants rather than the bryophytes, the lichens and the fungi. It is thought that the species richness figures would increase considerably if these groups were to be included. Also check out the size of Australia compared with the USA , East Asia, and Europe.</p>
