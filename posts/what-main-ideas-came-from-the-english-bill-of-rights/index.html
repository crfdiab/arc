<h2 id=what-main-ideas-came-from-the-english-bill-of-rights>What main ideas came from the English Bill of Rights?</h2>
<p>The English Bill of Rights created a constitutional monarchy in England, meaning the king or queen acts as head of state but his or her powers are limited by law. Under this system, the monarchy couldn’t rule without the consent of Parliament, and the people were given individual rights.</p>
<h2 id=what-ideas-are-contained-in-the-bill-of-rights>What ideas are contained in the Bill of Rights?</h2>
<p>The entire Bill of Rights was created to protect rights the original citizens believed were naturally theirs, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Freedom of Religion.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Freedom of Speech, Press, Petition, and Assembly.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Privacy.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Due Process of Law.</p>

<h2 id=equality-before-the-law-what-are-three-enlightenment-ideas-used-in-the-declaration-of-independence>Equality Before the Law. What are three Enlightenment ideas used in the declaration of Independence?</h2>
<p>Core Enlightenment ideals used in the Declaration of Independence include the idea that all people are entitled to certain rights just by virtue of being human, the belief that a government’s legitimacy comes from the consent of the governed, and the idea that a government’s main purpose is to protect the rights of the people.

<h2 id=what-was-the-impact-of-the-enlightenment-on-human-rights>What was the impact of the Enlightenment on Human Rights?</h2>
<p>The various English parliamentary documents on rights had been specifically limited to freeborn Englishmen. They made no larger claims. The Enlightenment helped broaden the claims, and its effects can be seen in the American offshoots of the English parliamentary tradition of rights.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-the-liberties-in-the-english-bill-of-rights>What are the liberties in the English Bill of Rights?</h2>
<p>Some of the key liberties and concepts laid out in the articles include: Freedom to elect members of Parliament, without the king or queen’s interference Freedom from cruel and unusual punishment and excessive bail Freedom from taxation by royal prerogative, without the agreement of Parliament</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-impact-of-the-english-bill-of-rights>What was the impact of the English Bill of Rights?</h2>
<p>For example, the 1791 U.S. Bill of Rights guarantees freedom of speech, trial by jury and protection from cruel and unusual punishment. The English Bill of Rights has had a long-lasting impact on the role of government in England.</p>
