<h2 id=what-is-the-true-meaning-of-anime>What is the true meaning of anime?</h2>

<h2 id=is-anime-the-japanese-word-for-cartoon>Is anime the Japanese word for cartoon?</h2>
<p>The Japanese created the word anime from the English word Animation and gave it the meaning “animated cartoon”. That has not changed from its creation to now from the Japanese point of view. Hence, in Japan/Japanese the word “anime(アニメ)“ basically translates to cartoon for us.</p>
<h2 id=what-does-anime-mean-to-the-japanese-culture>What does anime mean to the Japanese culture?</h2>

In Japanese culture, anime is actually a term for any mass-produced animation, Japanese or non-Japanese. And, importantly, in Japan, anime is not just a culture for kids.

<h2 id=why-do-they-call-it-anime>Why do they call it anime?</h2>
<p>“Anime” is strange because it’s a loan word from English to Japanese, that got shortened and then re-borrowed back to English from Japanese, each time it changed meaning slightly animation -> cartoon -> Japanese cartoons. Literally, anime means animation and is synonymous with cartoons.</p>
<h2 id=is-anime-very-popular>Is anime very popular?</h2>
<p>Anime and manga have long been at the heart of Japanese culture, with a consistent wave of popularity between the generations. One of the main reasons why anime has stood the test of time and grown in popularity across the world is due to its unique ability to grow with its viewers.</p>
