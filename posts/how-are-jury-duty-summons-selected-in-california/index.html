<h2 id=how-long-are-you-on-call-for-jury-duty-california>How long are you on call for jury duty California?</h2>
<p>Jurors are on call for two weeks (10 consecutive court days beginning the first day you are on call). This court is a “one appearance, or one trial” court. You will be required to make only one appearance in court for jury selections held that day, or serve for one trial (jury selection may take more than one day).</p>

<p>When you do not appear for jury duty, you will be sent a postcard stating you failed to appear. You will automatically be assigned a new date for jury duty if you do not respond.

<p>You’ll need your 9 digit Juror Participant Number located on the front of your Summons for Jury Service. Once you log in, click on the Current Status link on the left side of the web page. You can also call the Jury Information Line at (800) 998-9035. Select option #2 on the menu and follow the voice prompts.</p>
<h2 id=how-are-jurors-selected-in-the-state-of-california>How are jurors selected in the state of California?</h2>
<p>In the American court system, criminal defendants are guaranteed the right to trial by a “jury of their peers”. In California, a pool of potential jurors is randomly selected from the local population of individuals eligible for jury duty. California law states a qualified juror as:</p>
<h2 id=what-happens-if-i-dont-show-up-for-jury-duty-in-california>What happens if I dont show up for jury duty in California?</h2>
<p>Jurors can prevent this from happening by showing they were excused from jury service. California courts have a great deal of discretion as to how to handle missing jurors. Some courts are far stricter than others. Many people are shunning jury duty these days for fear of catching COVID 19.</p>

<p>The claim that more than 449,000 Californians received jury summons who were not U.S. citizens because they were listed as registered voters is false and inaccurate.
