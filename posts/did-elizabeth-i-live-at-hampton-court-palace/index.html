<h2 id=did-elizabeth-i-live-at-hampton-court-palace>Did Elizabeth I live at Hampton Court Palace?</h2>
<p>Queen Elizabeth I’s court was often at Hampton Court Palace, but it was one of the Queen’s least favourite residences. She fell ill of smallpox twice at the palace and, a story goes, she saw the ghost of Edward VI’s governess there. However, much of the Tudor palace survives and is open to the public.</p>
<h2 id=can-u-stay-at-hampton-court>Can u stay at Hampton Court?</h2>

<h2 id=are-there-still-grace-and-favour-apartments-at-hampton-court>Are there still grace and Favour apartments at Hampton Court?</h2>
<p>Hampton Court apartments were generally occupied by retired soldiers and diplomats or (more usually) by their widows. Grace and favour apartments have been discontinued at Hampton Court.</p>

<p>Three Lives of Hampton Court. It has a long varied past, with connections to some of the most famous (or infamous) people in English History. Along with St. James Palace in London, it is only one of two palaces that survive from the many owned by King Henry VIII.</p>
<h2 id=are-there-still-people-living-in-hampton-court-palace>Are there still people living in Hampton Court Palace?</h2>
<p>Residents regularly complained that the palace was ‘perishingly cold’ and damp, and some had no access to hot water. Apartments continued to be granted as late as the 1960s, and although the practice has now ceased, there are still a couple of elderly residents living at Hampton Court today!

<h2 id=who-was-the-last-monarch-to-live-in-hampton-court>Who was the last monarch to live in Hampton Court?</h2>
<p>Since there were few residents left, grace and favor apartments at the Hampton Court Palace were discontinued by 2017. Nor does any member of the royal family live in the palace. The last monarch to live there was George III, who reportedly hated Hampton Court and declared that he would never live there.</p>
