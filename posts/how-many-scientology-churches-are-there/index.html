<h2 id=how-many-scientology-buildings-are-there-in-the-world>How many Scientology buildings are there in the world?</h2>
<p>The Church of Scientology According to the official Scientology website, there are over 8,500 Scientology Churches, Missions and affiliated groups in 165 countries around the world.</p>
<h2 id=what-city-has-the-most-scientologists>What city has the most Scientologists?</h2>
<p>Los Angeles, California, has the largest concentration of Scientologists and Scientology-related organizations in the world, with the church’s most visible presence being in the Hollywood district of the city.</p>
<h2 id=where-is-scientology-most-practiced>Where is Scientology most practiced?</h2>
<p>The Church of Scientology has been given tax-exempt status in its home country, the United States, and has received full recognition as a religion in various other countries such as Italy, South Africa, Australia, Sweden, New Zealand, Portugal and Spain; it thus enjoys and regularly cites the constitutional protection …</p>
<h2 id=do-scientologist-believe-in-christmas>Do Scientologist believe in Christmas?</h2>
<p>Scientologists also celebrate holidays such as Christmas, Easter and New Year’s Eve, as well as other local celebrations. Scientologists also celebrate religious holidays depending on other religious beliefs, as Scientologists very often retain their original affiliations with religions in which they were raised.</p>
<h2 id=how-many-scientologists-exist-today>How many Scientologists exist today?</h2>
<p>It’s hard to say exactly how many people practice Scientology in the U.S. Many critics suggest that there are between 25,000 and 55,000 active Scientologists, but the church’s website claims growth of more than 4.4 million adherents each year.</p>

<h2 id=what-do-scientologists-do-at-church>What do Scientologists do at church?</h2>
<p>By taking all of the classes the Church of Scientology offers, Scientologists believe that one can reclaim his true thetan form, become closer to God (or the Supreme Being), and unlock abilities to control life, matter, energy, space, and time that have been repressed by being in human form.</p>
<h2 id=do-scientologists-drink-alcohol>Do Scientologists drink alcohol?</h2>
<p>While the whole program’s meant to rid people’s bodies of harmful toxins, there’s no rule in the Scientology handbook that says churchgoers can’t consume alcohol or cigarettes on a regular basis — you know, substances known to negatively affect the human body.</p>
<h2 id=why-do-scientologists-stare>Why do Scientologists stare?</h2>
<p>Reports of the “thousand mile stare” common to Scientologists are a direct result of this training routine. However, the Scientologist isn’t staring at you, he’s staring through you. Rather than intimidating you by “confront”, the Scientologist is paradoxically in a non-confront.</p>
<h2 id=do-scientologists-believe-in-medicine>Do Scientologists believe in medicine?</h2>
<p>“Scientologists seek conventional medical treatment for medical conditions,” the church said in a statement. “Scientologists use prescription drugs when physically ill and also rely on the advice and treatment of medical doctors.</p>
<h2 id=do-scientologists-have-a-dress-code>Do Scientologists have a dress code?</h2>
<p>In addition to Roger’s excellent answer, Staff Members in the Scientology churches (known as Organizations, or Orgs) also wear uniforms while they are on duty, generally black pants or skirt and a white shirt or blouse, often with a silver and black tie for the men.</p>
<h2 id=who-are-the-members-of-the-church-of-scientology>Who are the members of the Church of Scientology?</h2>
<p>The Sea Organization (Sea Org) is a Scientology organization, which the Church of Scientology describes as a “fraternal religious order, comprising the church’s most dedicated members”. All Scientology management organizations are controlled exclusively by members of the Sea Org.</p>
<h2 id=how-many-scientologists-are-there-in-the-world>How many Scientologists are there in the world?</h2>
<p>Some believe Scientology is decreasing in popularity, a sentiment echoed in the popular documentary Going Clear, which puts the organization’s ranks below 50,000, according to The Atlantic.</p>
<h2 id=is-the-church-of-scientology-a-tax-exempt-religion>Is the Church of Scientology a tax exempt religion?</h2>
<p>Scientology is legally recognized as a tax-exempt religion in the United States and other countries, and the Church of Scientology emphasizes this as proof that it is a bona fide religion. Scientology describes itself as the study and handling of the spirit in relationship to itself, others, and all of life.</p>
<h2 id=what-did-jane-doe-say-about-the-church-of-scientology>What did Jane Doe say about the Church of Scientology?</h2>
<p>In response to Jane Doe’s claim that the church “is nothing more than a cult built on mind control,” Scientology’s lawyers told Us Weekly, “The church will vigorously defend itself against these unfounded allegations.” Scroll down to see more celebrity Scientologists and stars who have left the church.</p>
