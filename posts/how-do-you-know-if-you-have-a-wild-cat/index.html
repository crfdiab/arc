<h2 id=how-do-you-know-if-you-have-a-wild-cat>How do you know if you have a wild cat?</h2>
<p>If you see a cat late at night when the outdoor cats should go home, or you see fresh paw prints from in the snow or ground in the early morning, that is most likely a stray cat. Feral cats tend to keep their distances from view or they stay within their home range in the outskirts.</p>
<h2 id=what-happens-if-you-touch-a-wild-cat>What happens if you touch a wild cat?</h2>
<p>Stray cats may tolerate touching while feral cats will not – not even by a caretaker who feeds it. As you get to know a stray it will relax over time while a feral cat will remain tense. If they feel threatened, a stray will hiss while a feral cat could lash out aggressively.</p>
<h2 id=what-do-you-do-if-you-find-a-wild-cat>What do you do if you find a wild cat?</h2>
<p>Tips on Handling Stray Cats on Your Own</p>
<ol>
<li>Provide Food and Water.</li>
<li>Lure the Cat Safely Inside a Carrier.</li>
<li>Trap the Cat – Only If the Cat Can’t Be Safely Lured into a Carrier.</li>
<li>Evaluate Whether It Is Appropriate to Take the Cat to a Local Animal Shelter.</li>
<li>Bring the Cat into Your Home and Provide Vet Care.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id=where-do-wild-cats-like-to-live>Where do wild cats like to live?</h2>
<p>African, Asiatic, and European wild cats are generally found in forested and scrubby landscapes, although they can be found in a wide variety of habitats.</p>
<h2 id=how-do-you-tell-if-a-cat-hates-you>How do you tell if a cat hates you?</h2>
<p>Insider spoke to several experts to find out the clear signs that show your cat is uncomfortable around you.</p>
<ol>
<li>Their tail is horizontal. A low-hanging tail isn’t a good sign.</li>
<li>They keep hiding from you.</li>
<li>They bite.</li>
<li>They walk away from you.</li>
<li>They hiss at you.</li>
<li>They’re friendly to everyone else except you.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id=what-does-it-mean-when-cats-hang-around-your-house>What does it mean when cats hang around your house?</h2>
<p>A cat coming to your doorstep could mean several things: Readily available food or water outside your home can attract feline pets. They will also hang around if they find a warm, safe, and quiet spot close to your house. Safety: A cat asking you to let them in is likely lost, hungry, or in need of safe refuge.</p>
<h2 id=why-you-should-never-feed-a-stray-cat>Why you should never feed a stray cat?</h2>
<p>They may spread diseases. Since stray cats wander around and do not have owners to care for them, they become prone to diseases and parasites. The stray you feed on your porch or backyard may be infested with fleas or worse, has rabies.</p>
<h2 id=why-does-a-cat-keep-coming-to-my-house>Why does a cat keep coming to my house?</h2>
<p>The main reasons a cat is coming to your home is to look for food, shelter, attention or to fight with resident cats. Fortunately, by making small adjustments to your home and garden you can stop unwanted cats from visiting.</p>
<h2 id=how-do-you-tell-if-a-cat-has-an-owner>How do you tell if a cat has an owner?</h2>
<p>Attempt to locate its owner by asking your neighbors if they have lost a cat or know anyone who has.</p>
<ol>
<li>It may help to take a picture of the cat along with you.</li>
<li>Posting a photo of the cat and a location where it was found on social media can also help you find the owner.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id=can-a-house-cat-survive-in-the-wild>Can a house cat survive in the wild?</h2>
<p>A domestic cat is very unlikely to end up living in a forest environment, but if they did, they would struggle to survive. Typically if a domestic cat ends up in the wild, it has gone missing or was abandoned by an owner. Most cats would rather stay in a suburban environment, as that is more familiar for them.</p>
