<h2 id=why-was-william-drake-not-popular-in-england>Why was William Drake not popular in England?</h2>
<p>Drake was definitely not popular! Although vital to the British government and the Queen herself, even the English people were somewhat divided in their view of Drake. Some admired his achievements and courage, whilst others resented him. Drake and his second cousin, Richard Hawkins, led one of the first slavery trips to West Africa in 1567.</p>
<h2 id=when-did-christopher-drake-set-off-on-his-expedition>When did Christopher Drake set off on his expedition?</h2>
<p>In 1577, Drake was secretly commissioned by Elizabeth I to set off on an expedition against the Spanish colonies on the American Pacific coast. He sailed with five ships, but by the time he reached the Pacific Ocean in October 1578 only one was left, Drake’s flagship the Pelican, renamed the Golden Hind.</p>
<h2 id=what-did-james-drake-do-in-the-west-indies>What did James Drake do in the West Indies?</h2>
<p>In 1570 and 1571, Drake made two profitable trading voyages to the West Indies. In 1572, he commanded two vessels in a marauding expedition against Spanish ports in the Caribbean. He saw the Pacific Ocean and captured the port of Nombre de Dios on the Isthmus of Panama.</p>
<h2 id=who-was-the-king-that-offered-drake-his-life>Who was the king that offered Drake his life?</h2>
<p>The king of Spain and Portugal, King Philip II was said to have offered the huge sum of 20,000 ducats (£4 million) for Drake’s life. Drake was definitely not popular!</p>

<h2 id=what-was-the-impact-of-drakes-raid-on-spain>What was the impact of Drake’s raid on Spain?</h2>
<p>Drake was greeted as a national hero upon his arrival in England; by that time news of his daring raids on the Spanish Main had reached most of Europe. His direct assault on the Spanish Empire was disastrous for the prestige of Spain and threatened the continued flow of New World riches, in the form of silver and gold, into its national treasury.</p>
<h2 id=what-did-edmund-drake-do-for-the-earl-of-bedford>What did Edmund Drake do for the Earl of Bedford?</h2>
<p>Edmund Drake was a tenant farmer for Francis Russell, 2nd Earl of Bedford. He fled his native county after being charged for “assault and robbery” in 1548.</p>
