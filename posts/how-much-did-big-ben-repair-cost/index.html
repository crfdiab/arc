<h2 id=how-much-did-big-ben-repair-cost>How much did Big Ben repair cost?</h2>
<p>The House of Commons (lower house of parliament) Commission said Thursday it was “extremely disappointed” that the cost of repairing the Elizabeth Tower housing the Big Ben bell will have to rise from 61.1 million pounds (about 79.8 million U.S. dollars) to 79.7 million pounds (about 104.2 million dollars).</p>
<h2 id=how-long-did-it-take-to-build-big-ben>How long did it take to build Big Ben?</h2>
<p>Completed in 1856, the tower was designed by architects Charles Barry and Augustus Welby Pugin and took 13 years to build. Its construction required 2600 cubic metres of brick and 850 cubic metres of stone. It began telling time on May 31, 1859. Big Ben chimed for the first time on July 11, 1859.</p>
<h2 id=what-materials-did-they-use-to-build-the-big-ben>What materials did they use to build the Big Ben?</h2>
<p>What is Big Ben made of? Materials to produce the Elizabeth Tower came from all over the United Kingdom, with cast iron girders from Regent’s Canal Ironworks being used. Yorkshire Anston stone and Cornish granite were used on the exterior and a Birmingham foundry supplied the Elizabeth Tower’s iron roofing plates.</p>

<h2 id=is-big-ben-named-after-a-black-man>Is Big Ben named after a black man?</h2>
<p>Big Ben is named after Benjamin Banneker. A black mathematician and astronomer. Inventor of the wooden clock.</p>
<h2 id=how-long-will-big-ben-be-silent>How Long Will Big Ben be silent?</h2>
<p>How long will Big Ben be silent for? Big Ben’s striking mechanism was locked on Monday, August 21 – with a crowd of 1,000 gathering to hear the last bongs at noon. The renovation work is expected to last for four years, meaning the there will be no regular bongs until 2021.</p>
<h2 id=when-did-big-ben-stop-ringing>When did Big Ben stop ringing?</h2>
<p>On April 30, 1997, at exactly 12:11 pm, London’s iconic Big Ben clock stops ticking. For 54 minutes, the most famous clock in the world failed to keep time.</p>
<h2 id=was-big-ben-bombed-in-ww2>Was Big Ben bombed in ww2?</h2>
<p>Among other problems, bomb damage inflicted on the tower during the Second World War had been found to be more extensive than first thought. Although the tower survived Nazi bombing, its roof and dials were damaged in a May 1941 air raid which destroyed the main House of Commons chamber.</p>
<h2 id=how-much-did-it-cost-to-repair-big-ben>How much did it cost to repair Big Ben?</h2>
<p>The cost of repairing the Elizabeth Tower, which houses the famous Big Ben bell, has risen by £18.6m following the discovery of bomb damage and asbestos. The need for more money was only discovered during a survey of the 177-year-old structure in central London.</p>
<h2 id=is-the-tower-of-big-ben-open-to-the-public>Is the Tower of Big Ben open to the public?</h2>
<p>The tower of Big Ben is not open to the general public. It is only open to certain residents of the United Kingdom by special arrangement through their member of parliament. These tours do not cost anything at present.</p>
<h2 id=when-was-the-construction-of-big-ben-started>When was the construction of Big Ben started?</h2>
<p>The construction of Big Ben was started in 1843. Edward John Dent was hired to design the clock. He died soon and his son took over the project. The first bell cast for the clock developed a crack, so a second bell was cast for the clock. The construction of Big Ben was finished in 1859.</p>
<h2 id=is-the-elizabeth-tower-really-called-big-ben>Is the Elizabeth Tower really called Big Ben?</h2>
<p>Technically, Big Ben is the name of the Great Bell inside the Elizabeth Tower. Normally, Elizabeth Tower and the Great Bell are collectively referred to as Big Ben. The real and official name of Big Ben (tower) is Elizabeth Tower.</p>
