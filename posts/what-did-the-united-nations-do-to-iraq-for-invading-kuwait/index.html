<h2 id=what-did-the-united-nations-do-to-iraq-for-invading-kuwait>What did the United Nations do to Iraq for invading Kuwait?</h2>
<p>By annexing Kuwait, Iraq gained control of 20 percent of the world’s oil reserves and, for the first time, a substantial coastline on the Persian Gulf. The same day, the United Nations Security Council unanimously denounced the invasion and demanded Iraq’s immediate withdrawal from Kuwait.</p>
<h2 id=what-un-resolutions-did-iraq-violate>What U.N. resolutions did Iraq violate?</h2>
<p>The United Nations Security Council, in Resolution 1441 (November 8, 2002), unanimously deplored Iraq’s lack of compliance with Resolution 687 (1991) on inspection, disarmament and renunciation of terrorism in Iraq, and went on to make several decisions under Chapter VII of the U.N. Charter.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-the-iraq-war-affect-the-united-states>How did the Iraq War affect the United States?</h2>
<p>As the United States departs Iraq after more than eight years of war and occupation, the stepped-up use of remote tactics and light-footprint special operations forces – anything but large-scale, troop-heavy intervention – is just one example of the lasting impact the Iraq war launched in March 2003 is having on American foreign policy.</p>
<h2 id=when-did-the-united-nations-put-sanctions-on-iraq>When did the United Nations put sanctions on Iraq?</h2>
<p>Sanctions against Iraq. The sanctions against Iraq were a near-total financial and trade embargo imposed by the United Nations Security Council on Ba’athist Iraq. They began August 6, 1990, four days after Iraq ‘s invasion of Kuwait, stayed largely in force until May 2003 (after Saddam Hussein ‘s being forced from power),…</p>
<h2 id=when-did-the-united-nations-end-the-occupation-of-iraq>When did the United Nations end the occupation of Iraq?</h2>
<p>The United Nations Security Council Resolution 1546 in 2004 looked forward to the end of the occupation and the assumption of full responsibility and authority by a fully sovereign and independent Interim Government of Iraq.</p>
<h2 id=who-was-involved-in-the-invasion-of-iraq>Who was involved in the invasion of Iraq?</h2>
<p>Troops for the invasion came primarily from the United States, the United Kingdom and Australia, but 29 other nations also provided some troops, and there were varying levels of assistance from Japan and other allied countries. Tens of thousands of private security personnel provided protection of infrastructure, facilities and personnel.</p>
