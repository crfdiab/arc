<h2 id=why-do-people-not-live-in-the-himalayas>Why do people not live in the Himalayas?</h2>
<p>The extreme climate found in the Himalayas limits the areas where people can build settlements, and the cold weather puts huge strains on those living there. Winters are bitter: well-trodden paths become impassable, restricting the transport of goods. Terracing is a common sight in the mountain valleys of Nepal.</p>
<h2 id=why-is-there-less-population-in-the-mountains>Why is there less population in the mountains?</h2>
