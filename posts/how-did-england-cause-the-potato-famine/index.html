<h2 id=how-did-england-cause-the-potato-famine>How did England cause the potato famine?</h2>
<p>The proximate cause of the famine was a potato blight which infected potato crops throughout Europe during the 1840s, causing an additional 100,000 deaths outside Ireland and influencing much of the unrest in the widespread European Revolutions of 1848.</p>
<h2 id=what-happened-in-the-potato-famine>What happened in the Potato Famine?</h2>
<p>The Irish Potato Famine, also known as the Great Hunger, began in 1845 when a fungus-like organism called Phytophthora infestans (or P. infestans) spread rapidly throughout Ireland. The infestation ruined up to one-half of the potato crop that year, and about three-quarters of the crop over the next seven years.</p>
<h2 id=how-many-people-died-in-the-irish-potato-famine>How many people died in the Irish Potato Famine?</h2>
<p>1 million people<br>
More than 1 million people died between 1846 and 1851 as a result of the Potato Famine. Many of these died from starvation. Many more died from diseases that preyed on people weakened by loss of food.</p>
<h2 id=what-did-they-eat-during-the-potato-famine>What did they eat during the potato famine?</h2>
<p>The analysis revealed that the diet during the Irish potato famine involved corn (maize), oats, potato, wheat, and milk foodstuffs. “It also shows how the notoriously monotonous potato diet of the poor was opportunistically supplemented by other foodstuffs, such as eggs and wheat, when made available to them.</p>

<p>The analysis revealed that the diet during the Irish potato famine involved corn (maize), oats, potato, wheat, and milk foodstuffs. Analysis of teeth of famine victims disclosed a great deal about their diet.</p>
<h2 id=why-was-the-potato-famine-so-bad-for-ireland>Why was the potato famine so bad for Ireland?</h2>
<p>Because the tenant farmers of Ireland—then ruled as a colony of Great Britain—relied heavily on the potato as a source of food, the infestation had a catastrophic impact on Ireland and its population. Before it ended in 1852, the Potato Famine resulted in the death of roughly one million Irish from starvation and related causes,…</p>
<h2 id=why-was-the-potato-famine-known-as-the-great-hunger>Why was the potato famine known as the Great Hunger?</h2>
<p>Known as the Great Hunger or an Gorta Mór, the Famine changed Ireland for ever, with the horrific death toll something that had not been seen since the Black Death hit the country in the 14th century.</p>
<h2 id=where-was-the-worst-famine-in-the-19th-century>Where was the worst famine in the 19th century?</h2>
<p>The Irish famine was the worst to occur in Europe in the 19th century: about one million people died from starvation or from typhus and other famine-related diseases. Great Famine, famine that occurred in Ireland in 1845–49 when the potato crop failed in successive years.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-the-free-church-help-during-the-potato-famine>How did the Free Church help during the Potato Famine?</h2>
<p>Additionally, the Free Church organised transport for over 3,000 men from the famine-struck regions to work on the Lowland railways. This both removed people who needed to be fed from the area and provided money for their families to buy food. The British government took early notice of the crop failure.</p>
