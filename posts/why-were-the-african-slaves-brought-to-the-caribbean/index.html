<h2 id=why-were-the-african-slaves-brought-to-the-caribbean>Why were the African slaves brought to the Caribbean?</h2>
<p>Africans were forcibly brought to British owned colonies in the Caribbean and sold as slaves to work on plantations. Those engaged in the trade were driven by the huge financial gain to be made, both in the Caribbean and at home in Britain.</p>
<h2 id=when-did-african-slaves-come-to-trinidad>When did African slaves come to Trinidad?</h2>
<p>1606<br>
Enslaved Africans in Trinidad In 1606, four hundred and seventy (470) enslaved Africans were brought to Trinidad by Dutch slaver Isaac Duverne. This was the first recorded instance of enslaved Africans being brought to the island.</p>
<h2 id=where-did-slaves-in-trinidad-and-tobago-come-from>Where did slaves in Trinidad and Tobago come from?</h2>
<p>Many slaves were brought in from the other colonies and from Africa. Plantations were established, production of cotton and sugar began, and trade increased markedly. By 1797, when Britain seized the island from Spain, Trinidad had begun its development as a plantation economy and a slave society.</p>
<h2 id=where-did-the-people-of-trinidad-and-tobago-come-from>Where did the people of Trinidad and Tobago come from?</h2>
<p>The ultimate origin of most African ancestry in the Americas is in West and Central Africa. The most common ethnic groups of the enslaved Africans in Trinidad and Tobago were Igbo, Kongo, Ibibio and Malinke people. All of these groups, among others, were heavily affected by the Atlantic slave trade.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-the-slave-trade-affect-trinidad-and-tobago>How did the slave trade affect Trinidad and Tobago?</h2>
<p>After the slave trade was abolished, however, the island’s economy suffered. The majority of Tobago’s population was African – many of them from the African continent. The British white population was small, and many of the planters were absentee owners.</p>
<h2 id=why-did-the-africans-come-to-the-caribbean>Why did the Africans come to the Caribbean?</h2>
<p>The use of African slaves was fundamental to growing colonial cash crops. Africans were brought to the Caribbean for the same reason they were brought to America to be slaves on plantations to raise sugar cane. The word recruitment emphasizes that the slaves were given some incentives or asked to join the slave trade this was not the case.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-the-french-encourage-people-to-migrate-to-trinidad>How did the French encourage people to migrate to Trinidad?</h2>
<p>A law, called the Cedula of Population, was passed to encourage migration to the island. Under this law, incentives such as free land and exemption from paying most taxes were granted. Many French settlers were willing to migrate to Trinidad. The Haitian revolution and the unrest in other French territories acted as additional incentives.</p>
