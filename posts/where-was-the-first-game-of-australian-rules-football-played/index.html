<p>Melbourne Grammar School<br>
On 7 August 1858, the first game of Australian Rules Football was played between Melbourne Grammar School and Scotch College, near the current site of the Melbourne Cricket Ground (MCG). The game was influenced by the Koorie game Marngrook and Aboriginal people continue to play a huge role in the game.</p>
<h2 id=why-did-the-vfl-become-the-afl>Why did the VFL become the AFL?</h2>
<p>The VFL, aiming to become a national competition, began expanding beyond Victoria to other Australian states in the 1980s, and changed its name to the AFL in 1990. Matches have been played in all states and mainland territories of Australia, as well as in New Zealand and China to promote the sport abroad.</p>

<p>Australian rules football began its evolution in Melbourne, Australia about 1858. The origins of Australian football before 1858 are still the subject of much debate, as there were a multitude of football games in Britain, Europe, Ireland and Australia whose rules influenced the early football games played in Melbourne.</p>
<h2 id=where-did-the-first-rules-of-football-come-from>Where did the first rules of football come from?</h2>
<p>The origins of Australian rules football date back to the late 1850s in Melbourne, the capital city of Victoria . There is documentary evidence of “foot-ball” being played in Australia as early as the 1820s. These games were poorly documented but appear to have been informal, one-off affairs.</p>
<h2 id=when-did-the-afl-first-start-in-australia>When did the AFL first start in Australia?</h2>
<p>The game quickly blossomed. The Geelong Football Club was formed in 1859 and in 1866 an updated set of rules was put in place and competition started.</p>

<p>Europeans naturally brought their own traditions of sport and games with balls. Many of these, in particular, English rugby football and Gaelic football (caid) were played in varying forms throughout the early 1800’s in various settlements across Australia.</p>
