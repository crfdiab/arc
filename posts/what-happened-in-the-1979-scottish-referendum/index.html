<h2 id=what-happened-in-the-1979-scottish-referendum>What happened in the 1979 Scottish referendum?</h2>
<p>The result was a majority in favour of devolution. A total of 1,230,937 (51.6%) voted at the referendum in favour of an Assembly, a majority of about 77,400 over those voting against. The government’s decision to abandon devolution led the SNP to withdraw its support for the Labour government.</p>
<h2 id=has-scotland-ever-voted-for-independence>Has Scotland ever voted for independence?</h2>
<p>Voters were asked: “Should Scotland be an independent country?” 44.7 percent of voters answered “Yes” and 55.3 percent answered “No”, with a record voter turnout of 85 percent. A second referendum on independence has been proposed, particularly since the UK voted to leave the European Union in a June 2016 referendum.</p>
<h2 id=was-there-a-referendum-for-scottish-devolution>Was there a referendum for Scottish devolution?</h2>
<p>The Scottish devolution referendum of 1997 was a pre-legislative referendum held in Scotland on Thursday 11 September 1997 over whether there was support for the creation of a Scottish Parliament with devolved powers, and whether the Parliament should have tax-varying powers. Turnout for the referendum was 60.4%.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-result-of-the-scottish-independence-referendum-in-2014>What was the result of the Scottish independence referendum in 2014?</h2>
<p>In the 2014 Scottish independence referendum, the No campaign won by 55 per cent to 45. In the five years since that vote Scotland has had three general elections, a Scottish Parliament vote, the Brexit referendum, a change of First Minister and two changes of Prime Minister.</p>
<h2 id=when-did-the-scottish-government-withdraw-the-referendum-bill>When did the Scottish government withdraw the Referendum Bill?</h2>
<p>The Scottish government withdrew the bill in September 2010, after failing to secure opposition support. The SNP repeated its commitment to hold an independence referendum when it published its manifesto for the 2011 Scottish Parliament election.</p>
<h2 id=why-do-the-scottish-greens-want-a-second-referendum>Why do the Scottish Greens want a second referendum?</h2>
<p>As we proposed on the first anniversary of the Independence Referendum, this is the Scottish Greens’ preferred way of deciding to hold a second referendum on Independence. If a new referendum is to happen, it should come about by the will of the people, and not be driven by calculations of party political advantage.</p>
<h2 id=why-are-the-scottish-conservatives-boycotting-the-referendum>Why are the Scottish Conservatives boycotting the referendum?</h2>
<p>The Scottish Conservatives have said they would boycott such a referendum. A case was brought to the Court of Session regarding the legality of Holyrood holding a referendum without a Section 30 order, but was dismissed as being “hypothetical, academic and premature”.</p>
