<h2 id=how-was-kelud-volcano-formed>How was Kelud volcano formed?</h2>
<p>Gunung Kelud is a composite stratovolcano built by the accumulation of numerous lava flows (eastern and northeastern flanks) pyroclastic flows, pyroclastic surges and lahar deposits from the youngest activity of the volcano.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-tectonic-setting-of-mount-kelud>What is the tectonic setting of Mount Kelud?</h2>
<p>Mt Kelud is located between the Pacific, Eurasian, and Australian tectonic plates. Mt Kelud lies on a subduction zone, where one plate dives under the other. Subduction causes big earth quakes and volcanoes. The earth is divided into plates, which are semi rigid, but they do move sometimes and interact with each other.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-cause-of-the-kelud-volcano-eruption>What was the cause of the Kelud volcano eruption?</h2>
<p>Kelud is a small volcano when compared with Indonesia’s others but, because of the lake at its summit and the frequency of its eruptions, it has been the source of many of Indonesia’s deadliest eruptions. The 1919 eruption prompted the creation of the Volcano Survey of Indonesia with its first task being how to drain the lake waters from Kelud.</p>

<p>Dan Dzurisin/U.S. Geological Survey Mount Kelud (5,679 feet [1,731 metres]), near Kediri in eastern Java, can be particularly devastating, because the water in its large crater lake is thrown out during eruption, causing great mudflows that rush down into the plains and sweep away all that is before them.</p>
<h2 id=what-kind-of-food-does-mount-kelud-produce>What kind of food does Mount Kelud produce?</h2>
<p>Teak is obtained from its forests, and its fertile plains produce rice, sugarcane, cotton, cassava, corn (maize), peanuts, coconuts, soybeans, and—from estates—coffee, cocoa, quinine, tobacco, and indigo. The area’s chief city is Kediri.</p>

<p>Over the following days, some of the displaced moved and found refuge with family and friends. By 18 Feb, a total of 83,088 people from 40 villages were still in the camps. Almost 30,000 houses and public buildings have been inundated with ash, with over 11,000 destroyed.</p>
