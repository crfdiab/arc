<h2 id=why-is-the-three-gorges-dam-environmentally-friendly>Why is the Three Gorges Dam environmentally friendly?</h2>
<p>Dam provides cheap hydroelectricity, no fossil fuels are burned so there is no carbon dioxide is produced. It stops the fish and other river animals from moving freely. The rise in shipping affects them too. Geological structure has become weak which means the area is prone to earthquakes.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-one-benefit-of-the-three-gorges-dam-that-will-be-felt-outside-of-china>What is one benefit of the Three Gorges Dam that will be felt outside of China?</h2>
<p>What are the advantages of the Three Gorges Dam? So far, the project has begun to bring benefits to Chinese people in mainly five aspects: flood control, power generation, navigation, drought resisting and tourism.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-the-environmental-impacts-of-the-three-gorges-dam>What are the environmental impacts of the Three Gorges Dam?</h2>
<p>The dam will flood some animal and plant habitats, while leaving others high and dry. Pollution in the water will make it impossible for many fish to survive. Three Gorges threatens more than 400 plant species, including the Chinese dove tree and dawn redwood, as well as a number of fish and the rare Baiji dolphin.</p>
<h2 id=how-has-the-three-gorges-dam-project-affected-the-flow-of-the-yangtze-river>How has the Three Gorges Dam project affected the flow of the Yangtze River?</h2>
<p>As well as producing electricity, the dam is intended to increase the Yangtze River’s shipping capacity. By providing flood storage space, the dam reduces the potential for floods downstream which have historically plagued the Yangtze Plain. In 1931, floods on the river caused the deaths of up to 4 million Chinese.</p>
<h2 id=which-is-the-oldest-dam-in-the-world>Which is the oldest dam in the world?</h2>
<p>Lake Homs Dam<br>
The Quatinah Barrage or Lake Homs Dam, located in Syria, is the oldest operational dam in the world. The dam was constructed during the reign of the Egyptian Pharaoh Sethi between 1319-1304 BC, and was expanded during the Roman period and between 1934 and 1938.</p>
<h2 id=why-was-the-three-gorges-dam-built-in-china>Why was the Three Gorges Dam built in China?</h2>
<p>The Three Gorges Dam was built in 2011 on the Yangtze River in an area called Chongqing. It was built to prevent flooding of main industrial areas in China following the major flood in 1998 of the river. The dam is 1. 4 miles long and is able to produce 18,000 MW of electricity.</p>
<h2 id=how-often-does-the-three-gorges-dam-flood>How often does the Three Gorges Dam flood?</h2>
<p>Plenty of farm land and China’s most important industrial area are built beside the river. The reservoir’s flood storage capacity is 22 cubic kilometres (18,000,000 acre·ft). This capacity will reduce the frequency of major downstream flooding from once every ten years to once every 100 years.</p>
<h2 id=how-is-the-three-gorges-project-contributing-to-sustainability>How is the Three Gorges Project contributing to sustainability?</h2>
<p>The research concluded that, based on both models, the Three Gorges Project as understood in 1988, and incorporating more recent sustainability analysis is contributing to enhanced sustainability. 1. Introduction</p>
<h2 id=who-is-the-father-of-the-three-gorges-project>Who is the father of the Three Gorges Project?</h2>
<p>Introduction The Three Gorges Project was first proposed by Dr. Sun Yat Sen, the ‘father of modern China’ ( Jackson and Sleigh, 2000, p. 227 ), in 1919. In 1988, an analysis into the feasibility of the project was carried out by the CIPM Yangtze Joint Venture (CYJV).</p>
