<p>In Italy, the largest part of population who live below the poverty line is located in the South. As of 2020, in three Southern regions, Basilicata, Calabria, and Campania, over 20 percent of the population was living below the poverty line.</p>
<h2 id=how-big-is-palermo-compared-to-other-cities-in-italy>How big is Palermo compared to other cities in Italy?</h2>
<p>This city is bigger than it seems. While it is nowhere near as big as New York or London, Palermo is still the fifth biggest city in Italy. Only Rome, Naples, Milan, and Turin are bigger. Case in point, choosing where to stay in the city makes a big difference.</p>
<h2 id=what-do-people-in-palermo-sicily-look-like>What do people in Palermo Sicily look like?</h2>
<p>Palermo locals embody what non-Italians typically think of when they think of Italian people: they are loud and passionate, they talk with their hands, they always seem as though they are arguing with each other, and they don’t really give a damn about the rules. In Palermo, if you’re annoyed with someone, you make it known.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-average-temperature-in-palermo-italy>What is the average temperature in Palermo Italy?</h2>

<p>Psst – I actually wrote an entire guide to Palermo Sicily here, so if you’re planning a trip to palermo then i strongly advise you to check that out as well! if you are travelling to palermo from mainland italy, you can take the bus. My go-to bus travel in Europe is always FlixBus.</p>
