<h2 id=what-causes-a-hot-spot-to-form>What causes a hot spot to form?</h2>
<p>Earth > Power of Plate Tectonics > Hot Spots A hot spot is an intensely hot area in the mantle below Earth’s crust. The heat that fuels the hot spot comes from very deep in the planet. This heat causes the mantle in that region to melt. The molten magma rises up and breaks through the crust to form a volcano.</p>
<h2 id=how-are-hotspots-formed-simple>How are hotspots formed simple?</h2>
<p>In geology, a hotspot or hot spot is a portion of the Earth’s surface which experiences volcanism. This may be caused by a rising mantle plume or some other cause. A volcanic hotspot is where magma pushes up from under the mantle and creates a volcano. The earth’s plates move along and another volcano is created later.</p>
<h2 id=how-does-a-hot-spot-volcano-form->How does a hot spot volcano form *?</h2>
<p>Volcanoes can only form in certain parts of our planet. The earth’s crust is broken into plates that “float” on the denser mantle below. These so-called “hotspot” volcanoes are created when a narrow stream of hot mantle rises up from deep inside the earth and melts a hole in the plate so that the magma can ooze upward.</p>
<h2 id=can-a-hot-spot-form-anywhere>Can a hot spot form anywhere?</h2>
<p>Where can a hot spot be found? Anywhere on a tectonic plate. They are RARELY found at plate boundaries. What forms on the lithosphere above a hot spot?</p>
<h2 id=where-can-hotspots-be-found>Where can hotspots be found?</h2>
<p>Hot spots are found in the ocean, and on continents. Often the hot spot creates a chain of volcanoes, as a plate moves across a relatively stationary mantle plume. The best example of a hot spot volcanic chain is the Hawaiian Islands.</p>
<h2 id=do-hot-spots-create-or-destroy-crust>Do hot spots create or destroy crust?</h2>
<p>These areas are called hot spots. The thin crust at the bottom of the ocean is most easily melted by magma. When this happens, the hot magma rises to make an underwater volcano, which keeps erupting and growing over the hot spot and can form an island.</p>
<h2 id=where-does-the-heat-from-a-hot-spot-come-from>Where does the heat from a hot spot come from?</h2>
<p>A hot spot is a region deep within the Earth’s mantle from which heat rises by convection. Bob Ballard travels to Hawai’i to explore the terrestrial and deep sea geology of the Mauna Kea, the tallest mountain in the world.</p>
<h2 id=how-does-a-hotspot-form-in-the-mantle>How does a hotspot form in the mantle?</h2>
<p>A frequently-used hypothesis suggests that hotspots form over exceptionally hot regions in the mantle, which is the hot, flowing layer of the Earth beneath the crust. Mantle rock in those extra-hot regions is more buoyant than the surrounding rocks, so it rises through the mantle and crust to erupt at the surface.</p>
<h2 id=what-causes-a-volcano-to-form-in-a-hot-spot>What causes a volcano to form in a hot spot?</h2>
<p>Heat from this extra hot magma causes melting and thinning of the rocky crust, which leads to widespread volcanic activity on Earth’s surface above the plume. While most volcanoes form along tectonic plate boundaries, mantle plumes and hot spots lead to their development as well. Hot spot volcanoes occur far from plate boundaries.</p>
<h2 id=what-does-it-mean-to-be-in-a-hotspot>What does it mean to be in a hotspot?</h2>
<p>Before we dive in to how to connect to a hotspot and related security issues, let’s define what we mean. While some people use the terms “hotspot” and “mobile hotspot” interchangeably, they have distinct meanings. Hotspot: A hotspot is a physical location where people can access the Internet, typically using Wi-Fi.</p>
