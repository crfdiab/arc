<h2 id=how-can-you-promote-religious-diversity-in-the-workplace>How can you promote religious diversity in the workplace?</h2>
<p>How to promote religious diversity at work. Organisations can start by accommodating their employees’ or potential employees’ need for prayer and observance of religious duties, subject to operational requirements. Ideally, this means having a quiet room for the purposes of prayer, contemplation and private reflection.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-dominant-religion-in-us>What is the dominant religion in us?</h2>

<h2 id=whats-the-percentage-of-protestants-in-new-york>What’s the percentage of Protestants in New York?</h2>
<p>Protestants are much less well represented among New York City’s religious members.
