<h2 id=where-did-amelia-earhart-fly-to>Where did Amelia Earhart fly to?</h2>
<p>Earhart made a solo trip from Honolulu, Hawaii, to Oakland, California, establishing her as the first woman — as well as the first person — to fly both across the Atlantic and the Pacific oceans. In April 1935, she flew solo from Los Angeles to Mexico City, and a month later she flew from Mexico City to New York.</p>

<p>Howland Island<br>
The pair made it to New Guinea in 21 days, even though Earhart was tired and ill. During the next leg of the trip, they departed New Guinea for Howland Island, a tiny island in the middle of the Pacific Ocean. July 2, 1937, was the last time Earhart and Noonan communicated with a nearby Coast Guard ship.</p>

<p>On June 1, 1937, Amelia Earhart took off from Oakland, California, on an eastbound flight around the world. It was her second attempt to become the first pilot ever to circumnavigate the globe. She flew a twin-engine Lockheed 10E Electra and was accompanied on the flight by navigator Fred Noonan.</p>

<p>Intrigued by Earhart — and her physical resemblance to Lindbergh — he invited her to be a passenger on a transatlantic flight. In June 1928, she became the first woman to fly across the Atlantic and then to fly back. (The duration of the first flight — 20 Hours, 40 Min — would become the title of her book on the subject.)</p>

<p>Beyond tomato juice, Amelia was all about hot chocolate, which she also kept in a thermos. According to The Independent, when Earhart became the first human to ever fly from Honolulu to California, she did so by drinking hot chocolate. Over 2]</p>

<p>But on July 2, 1937, before she reached her destination, Earhart and her navigator Fred Noonan are thought to have disappeared in the central Pacific Ocean on their way to Howland Island after taking off from the city of Lae in Papua New Guinea.</p>

<p>Sadly, Amelia and her navigator, Fred Noonan, disappeared over the Pacific Ocean on July 2nd. According to History.com, the U.S. Coast Guard was the last to pick up radio messages indicating that she was lost and low in fuel. They were on their way to Howland Island from Papua New Guinea.</p>
