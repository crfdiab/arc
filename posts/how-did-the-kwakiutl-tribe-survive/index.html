<h2 id=what-does-the-kwakiutl-tribe-live-in>What does the Kwakiutl tribe live in?</h2>

<h2 id=what-does-kwakiutl-house-look-like>What does Kwakiutl house look like?</h2>
<p>What were Kwakiutl homes like in the past? The Kwakiutls lived in coastal villages of rectangular cedar-plank houses with bark roofs. Usually these houses were large (up to 100 feet long) and each one housed several familes from the same clan (as many as 50 people.)</p>
