<h2 id=why-did-glasgow-remove-trams>Why did Glasgow remove trams?</h2>
<p>From the end of the World War I, private car ownership was increasing across Britain. Trams were seen to impede on the freedom of private car owners in the city: the authorities believed that removing the tramways and replacing them with buses would allow for easier transport in and around Glasgow.</p>
<h2 id=when-did-glasgow-have-trams>When did Glasgow have trams?</h2>
<p>Q1: What were the Tramways? Glasgow Corporation (GC) Tramways began in 1894. The system comprised non-standard gauge tramlines (the Permanent Way) and horse-drawn tramcars. Overhead electric traction was trialled in 1897 and replaced the old system by 1902.</p>

<h2 id=why-are-there-no-trams-in-london>Why are there no trams in London?</h2>
<p>The plans to remove trams from London had been mooted for years, but they were given a temporary reprieve by the outbreak of the second world war. So why did they disappear? Well, it was argued that trams caused traffic congestion; their fixed routes made it hard for other traffic to bypass them.</p>
<h2 id=why-did-the-uk-get-rid-of-trams>Why did the UK get rid of trams?</h2>
<p>As a result regulation was introduced in 1932. Trams were removed from the 30s onwards partly because they impeded car owners wanting to drive freely in cities. It was thought that by getting rid of trams, and replacing them with diesel buses, everyone could get around faster.</p>
<h2 id=when-did-tram-cars-stop-in-glasgow>When did tram cars stop in Glasgow?</h2>
<p>4 September 1962<br>
The tram system was gradually phased out between 1949 and 1962 (in favour of trolley and diesel-powered buses), with the final trams operating on 4 September 1962.</p>

<p>The Independent joins the thronging crowd at the Gyle Centre station to the west of the city to witness this small piece of transport history They are three years late, £231 million over-budget and their very name has become a byword for council ineptitude.</p>
<h2 id=how-big-are-the-trams-in-the-uk>How big are the trams in the UK?</h2>
<p>This is a list of town tramway systems in the United Kingdom divided by constituent country and by regions of England. It includes all tram systems, past and present.

<h2 id=are-there-any-tramways-in-south-london>Are there any tramways in South London?</h2>
