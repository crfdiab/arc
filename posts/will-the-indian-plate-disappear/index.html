<h2 id=will-the-indian-plate-disappear>Will the Indian plate disappear?</h2>
<p>The Indian Plate is currently moving north-east at five centimetres (2.0 in) per year, while the Eurasian Plate is moving north at only two centimetres (0.79 in) per year. This is causing the Eurasian Plate to deform, and the Indian Plate to compress at a rate of four millimetres (0.16 in) per year.</p>
<h2 id=what-continent-did-india-break-off-of>What continent did India break off of?</h2>
<p>Asian continent<br>
About 225 million years ago, India was a large island still situated off the Australian coast, and a vast ocean (called Tethys Sea) separated India from the Asian continent. When Pangaea broke apart about 200 million years ago, India began to forge northward.</p>
<h2 id=is-india-drifting-away-from-asia>Is India drifting away from Asia?</h2>
<p>We know that India is colliding with Asia, a process that began 50 million years ago and continues to this day. This collision formed the Himalayas. Nowadays, India is still moving in the same direction but with a lower velocity of about 4 cm/year, due to the resistance of the Eurasian plate.</p>
<h2 id=why-is-the-indian-plate-still-moving>Why is the Indian plate still moving?</h2>
<p>The Himalayan tectonic plate is moving towards Central Asia at a speed of 2cm/year—the reason for repeated earthquakes. The lithosphere of the Earth is broken into tectonic plates or slabs underlying each continent. When tectonic plates collide, further movement is impeded.</p>
<h2 id=what-if-india-did-not-collide-with-asia>What if India did not collide with Asia?</h2>
<p>But if Indian plate would not collided with Eurasian plate, The great Himalayan would not be formed and the rains which Monsoon brings would be just dreams. The major portion of Indian subcontinent would be desert. The river drainage system we enjoy, the fertile land we cultivate all of it can’t be imagined.</p>
<h2 id=is-india-moving-5cm-per-year>Is India moving 5cm per year?</h2>
<p>Around 120 million years ago, what is now India broke off and started slowly migrating north, at about 5 centimeters per year.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-name-of-the-plane-that-went-missing-in-malaysia>What was the name of the plane that went missing in Malaysia?</h2>
<p>MH370 plane disappearance. The missing Malaysia Airlines plane, flight MH370, had 239 people on board and was en route from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing on 8 March 2014 when air traffic control staff lost contact with it. The search for the plane eventually focused on a 120,000 sq km area of seabed about 2,000km off the coast …</p>
<h2 id=where-did-the-plane-go-down-in-the-indian-ocean>Where did the plane go down in the Indian Ocean?</h2>
<p>In November 2016, a report found the recovered wing flaps from the plane were not in the landing position when the plane went down in the Indian Ocean. It was a significant finding that helped investigators say with more certainty that the flight most likely made a rapid and uncontrolled descent into the Indian Ocean.</p>
<h2 id=where-was-the-search-for-the-missing-plane>Where was the search for the missing plane?</h2>
<p>The search for the plane eventually focused on a 120,000 sq km area of seabed about 2,000km off the coast of Perth in the southern Indian Ocean. It has now been suspended with no trace of the aircraft found there, and is likely to remain the world’s greatest aviation mystery.</p>
