<h2 id=what-is-a-chambered-nautilus-and-where-does-it-live>What is a chambered nautilus and where does it live?</h2>
<p>The chambered nautilus lives in deep waters of the open ocean and is one of very few species of shelled invertebrates that live in the water column instead of in contact with the seafloor or reef surface. The animal only lives in the outermost chamber of the shell.</p>
<h2 id=where-can-nautilus-be-found>Where can nautilus be found?</h2>
<p>Indo-Pacific<br>
Nautiluses are found in only the Indo-Pacific, from 30° N to 30° S latitude and 90° E to 175° E longitude. They inhabit the deep slopes of coral reefs. Nautiluses usually inhabit depths of several hundred metres.</p>
<h2 id=how-do-chambered-nautilus-adapt>How do chambered nautilus adapt?</h2>
<p>The older closed chambers of the shell contain an argon-nitrogen gas mixture and a liquid saline solution. The chambers are connected by a tube called a siphuncle that gives the nautilus the ability to change the ratio of liquid to gas which modifies its weight.</p>
<h2 id=is-the-chambered-nautilus-dangerous>Is the chambered nautilus dangerous?</h2>
<p>Now, scientists say, humans are loving the chambered nautilus to death, throwing its very existence into danger. “A horrendous slaughter is going on out here,” said Peter D. Ward, a biologist from the University of Washington, during a recent census of the marine creature in the Philippines. “They’re nearly wiped out.”</p>
<h2 id=how-many-hearts-does-a-nautilus-have>How many hearts does a nautilus have?</h2>
<p>The cephalopod nautilus, the mesmerizing spiral-shelled marine animal, only has a single heart that pumps blood, unlike its three-hearted relatives. It probably doesn’t need the two extra hearts because of their relatively smaller size and the creature’s very sedentary lifestyle.</p>
<h2 id=do-chambered-nautilus-have-eyes>Do chambered nautilus have eyes?</h2>
<p>The chambered nautilus (Nautilus) has eyes that are large, about 10 mm (0.39 inch) across, with millions of photoreceptors.</p>
<h2 id=how-long-can-a-nautilus-live>How long can a nautilus Live?</h2>
<p>15 to 20 years<br>
Unlike other cephalopods, nautiluses are relatively long-lived, reaching ages of 15 to 20 years, or more. They grow slowly, maturing around 10 to 15 years of age, and produce a small number of eggs that require at least a year-long incubation period.</p>
<h2 id=can-you-keep-nautilus-as-pets>Can you keep nautilus as pets?</h2>
<p>Unfortunately no cephalopod does good as a pet for anyone but an expert or zoo/aquarium. Although octopus and cuttlefish are poor captives, nautilus are bad for completely different reasons. They need a chiller and often bob up and down as movement, so a large, refrigerated, cylindrical tank would be needed.</p>
<h2 id=can-you-eat-a-nautilus>Can you eat a nautilus?</h2>
<p>They are edible. They can be fried or grilled and taste a bit fishier conpared to othe cephalopods.</p>
<h2 id=can-i-own-a-nautilus>Can I own a nautilus?</h2>
<h2 id=can-you-legally-own-a-nautilus>Can you legally own a nautilus?</h2>
<p>Nautiluses Are Endangered The main reason why NOT to buy a nautilus is simply because nautiluses are an endangered species. Regulations, which are in effect since January 2017, dictate that any country wishing to export nautiluses (live, dead, shell, jewelry, etc.)</p>
<h2 id=what-animal-has-a-pinhole-eye>What animal has a pinhole eye?</h2>
<p>genus Nautilus<br>
The most impressive pinhole eyes are found in the mollusk genus Nautilus, a member of a cephalopod group that has changed little since the Cambrian Period (about 541 million to about 485 million years ago). These organisms have eyes that are large, about 10 mm (0.39 inch) across, with millions of photoreceptors.</p>
<h2 id=where-does-the-chambered-nautilus-live-in-the-world>Where does the Chambered Nautilus Live in the world?</h2>
<p>The title “The Chambered Nautilus” refers to a sea creature that lives in the western Pacific and the Indian oceans and has a hard external shell, or exoskeleton.</p>
<h2 id=how-does-the-chambered-nautilus-regulate-its-depth>How does the chambered nautilus regulate its depth?</h2>
<p>The chambered Nautilus inhabits different segments of the shell as it grows, continuously growing new, larger “cells” into which it moves its internal organs as it grows in maturity. All of the smaller chambers, once uninhabited, are used in the method described above to regulate depth.</p>
<h2 id=is-the-chambered-nautilus-a-squid-or-cuttlefish>Is the chambered nautilus a squid or cuttlefish?</h2>
<p>The chambered nautilus, a cephalopod, is a relative of the ancient ammonoids and a modern relative of squid, octopus, and cuttlefish. Unlike its relatives, the nautilus has an external shell.</p>
<h2 id=why-is-the-chambered-nautilus-on-the-endangered-species-list>Why is the chambered nautilus on the Endangered Species List?</h2>
<p>Habitat degradation throughout much of their range. Given their slow growth, late maturity, low reproductive output, and low mobility, chambered nautiluses are particularly vulnerable to overfishing. The chambered nautilus, Nautilus pompilius, is listed as threatened under the Endangered Species Act .</p>
