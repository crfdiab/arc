<h2 id=why-does-the-denver-airport-have-a-blue-horse>Why does the Denver airport have a blue horse?</h2>
<p>The 32-foot sculpture of a seemingly bloodthirsty bronco is the work of artist Luis Jiménez. Commissioned as public art for the airport and installed in 2008, the horse represents the wild spirit of the old American west. It has also come to represent death, destruction, and deluded debates.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-story-behind-blucifer>What is the story behind Blucifer?</h2>
<p>Blucifer is a nickname that was given by the locals due to the demonic look and deadly history of the statue. The artist wanted the sculpture to capture the spirit of the wild west in America, representing freedom and boldness to anyone who saw it.</p>
<h2 id=what-does-a-blue-horse-signify>What does a blue horse signify?</h2>
<p>The blue horse symbolism is born from the first horse that the Indians could catch and ride. This horse spirit animal was depicted as a clan animal, and it gave life to tribal dances. Native Americans viewed this animal as a symbol of motility, strength, power, and stamina and had a deep respect for it.</p>
<h2 id=did-they-take-down-the-blue-horse-at-dia>Did they take down the blue horse at DIA?</h2>
<p>DENVER – If “Blucifer” scares the living hell out of you with its creepy, glowing red eyes, I’ve got bad news for you.</p>
<h2 id=why-does-the-blue-horse-have-red-eyes>Why does the Blue horse have red eyes?</h2>
<p>In the last seven years, the airport’s electrical team has only changed them just twice, Donohoe and her colleagues explained. Those red eyes though, that people point to as evidence of Mustang’s demonic nature, are actually a tribute to the artist’s father. Jiménez was born in El Paso, Texas in 1940.</p>
<h2 id=is-a-blue-horse-real>Is a blue horse real?</h2>
<p>Although no one has real evidence that blue horses exist, there are many tales of sightings across the region from legions of true believers. Legend has it that a horse called “Big Lex” turned blue from grazing in nourishing bluegrass pastures his entire life.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-jimenez-died>How did Jimenez died?</h2>
<p>Accident<br>
Luis Jiménez/Cause of death<br>
Jiménez’s works were considered controversial by the art world yet respected in Hispanic communities for his ability to poignantly represent a different perspective and narrative of the history and culture of Mexico and the Southwest. Jiménez died tragically in a studio accident on June 13, 2006 in Hondo, NM.</p>
<h2 id=what-two-colors-are-mentioned-in-the-blue-horse-poem>What two colors are mentioned in the Blue horse poem?</h2>
<p>He felt that colours had special meanings — blue was a male colour that stood for calm and peaceful behaviour. Yellow was a female colour, gentle and happy. Red was the colour of war and violence. Horses made him think of freedom and a pure spirit.</p>
<h2 id=what-does-it-mean-to-see-horse-in-dream>What does it mean to see horse in Dream?</h2>
<p>A horse in a dream might symbolize freedom, energy, strength, endurance, stamina, power, but also hard work. It might signify male sexual energy and masculinity. Running horses symbolize freedom and release of repressed energy.</p>
<h2 id=why-does-the-blue-horse-have-red-eyes-1>Why does the blue horse have red eyes?</h2>
<h2 id=how-rare-are-blue-roan-horses>How rare are blue roan horses?</h2>
<p>Are blue roan horses rare? Blue roans are likely the rarest roan color. But no, they aren’t rare, but they are definitely not as common as many other equine colors.</p>
<h2 id=how-tall-is-the-haunted-blue-horse-statue>How tall is the Haunted Blue Horse statue?</h2>
<p>Blucifer is 32 feet tall and has red eyes that glow. Conspiracy theorists believe the statue represents the fourth horseman of the apocalypse — or that it’s haunted. […] […] assustador chamado de BLUCIFER. Blucifer é 32 metros de altura e tem olhos vermelhos que brilham.</p>
<h2 id=is-there-a-horse-statue-in-denver-airport>Is there a horse statue in Denver Airport?</h2>
<p>If you’re flying in to Denver International Airport, you might have some questions about the colossal, demon-eyed horse statue staring into your very soul as you make your descent. Here are some answers.</p>
<h2 id=whats-the-name-of-the-blue-horse-at-the-airport>What’s the name of the Blue Horse at the airport?</h2>
<p>It’s the first thing travelers see after the many miles of near empty prairie driving out to the airport, and the last thing new arrivals will witness before heading to the city.</p>
<h2 id=is-the-blue-mustang-sculpture-here-to-stay>Is the Blue Mustang sculpture here to stay?</h2>
<p>Thus, Blue Mustang is here to stay. He might have even grown on residents more regularly at the airport who would be put off by his ceaseless gaze and could seek to uproot him. Besides, like all great art pieces, Blucifer has at least been able to get the people of Denver talking again about what public art should and should not be.</p>
