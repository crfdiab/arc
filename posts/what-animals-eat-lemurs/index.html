<p>Lemur Predators Lemurs have both natural and introduced predators. Native predators include the Fossa (Cryptoprocta ferox), Madagascar Harrier-hawk (Polyboroides radiatus), Madagascar Buzzard (Buteo brachypterus) and the Madagascar Ground Boa (Acrantophis madagascariensis).</p>
<h2 id=what-animals-kill-lemurs>What animals kill lemurs?</h2>
<p>The Fossa is the main natural predator of the Lemur. This is a type of cat like mammal that is only found in the area of the Madagascar Islands. It is closely related to the Mongoose family which is very strong and agile. The number of Lemurs that the Fossa has consumed in recent years is very high.</p>

Additionally, it has been observed eating decayed wood, earth, insects and small vertebrates. Lemurs have several different habitats on Madagascar ranging from rainforests to dry areas of the island.</p>
<h2 id=what-kind-of-forest-does-a-lemur-live-in>What kind of forest does a lemur live in?</h2>
<p>They inhabit deciduous forests with grass floors or forests along riverbanks (gallery forests). Some also inhabit wet, closed brush where few trees grow. The Lemur is thought to require primary forest (forests which have remained undisturbed by human activity) in order to survive.</p>
<h2 id=what-kind-of-animals-can-you-eat-in-the-forest>What kind of animals can you eat in the forest?</h2>
<p>Fish is the next animal that you can eat when you trapped in the forest. If the forest is closed with the river, you can try to catch the fish by using handmade spear. Catfish, snakehead, trout and freshwater salmon are the examples of fishes that can be eaten in order to survive. 12.</p>
