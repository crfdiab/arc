<h2 id=is-pork-eaten-in-kenya>Is pork eaten in Kenya?</h2>
<p>In Kenya the current per capita consumption of pork is 0.4 kg, behind bovine meat at 12.2 kg, mutton/goat at 2.2 kg, and poultry at 0.6 kg (8). In terms of pig abattoirs, few exist in Kenya and much of the slaughter takes place informally in farms and unlicensed slaughter points.</p>
<h2 id=what-cultures-dont-eat-bacon>What cultures dont eat bacon?</h2>
<p>Religious restrictions on the consumption of pork are a common food taboo, particularly in the Middle East among Jews and Muslims. Swine were prohibited in ancient Syria and Phoenicia, and the pig and its flesh represented a taboo observed, Strabo noted, at Comana in Pontus.</p>
<h2 id=what-do-most-people-eat-in-kenya>What do most people eat in Kenya?</h2>
<p>Staples are maize and other cereals depending on the region, including millet and sorghum eaten with various meats and vegetables. The foods that are universally eaten in Kenya are ugali, sukuma wiki, and nyama choma.</p>
<h2 id=why-cant-muslims-eat-gelatin>Why can’t Muslims eat gelatin?</h2>
<p>Gelatin is a mixture of peptides and proteins produced by partial hydrolysis of collagen extracted from the skin, bones, and connective tissues of animals such as domesticated cattle, chicken, pigs, and fish. As pigs are considered as haram in Islam, So, Muslims should not consume gelatin.</p>
<h2 id=what-kind-of-food-do-they-eat-in-kenya>What kind of food do they eat in Kenya?</h2>
<p>Coastal Kenyan food is loaded with spices and coconut. The taste is piquant and flavorful, and the cooking styles can be found from the beaches to the capital city of Nairobi. To try for yourself, start with these eight dishes that tell the history of the region.</p>
<h2 id=what-kind-of-food-is-matoke-in-kenya>What kind of food is matoke in Kenya?</h2>
<p>Matoke is originally a dish from Uganda, though it is widely available and popular in Kenya as well. Plantain bananas are cooked up in a pot with some oil, tomatoes, onions, garlic, chilies, meat (optional), and lemon juice.</p>
<h2 id=what-kind-of-food-do-they-eat-in-zanzibar>What kind of food do they eat in Zanzibar?</h2>
<p>The fragrant rice is fantastic to eat with a form of meat stew and a few slices of fresh tomato and onions. Biriyani is another form of spiced rice that is a popular Kenyan food on the coast. Even though it’s in Tanzania, I’ve enjoyed some of the best pilau and biryani I’ve ever eaten on the island of Zanzibar!</p>
<h2 id=what-kind-of-vegetables-are-used-in-kenyan-stew>What kind of vegetables are used in Kenyan stew?</h2>
<p>Kenyan stew dishes might also include a few other base vegetable ingredients such as carrots, peppers, peas, or potatoes. The sauce is usually formed from a light tomato base and accented with onion, salt and pepper, and that essential mchuzi mix!</p>
