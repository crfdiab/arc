<h2 id=when-were-uggs-made-in-australia>When were Uggs made in Australia?</h2>
<p>1981<br>
Ugg Australia® was established in 1981, we have been proudly crafting an Australian icon for almost 4 decades. Today, we’re the ONLY Australian sheepskin footwear manufacturer with our own tannery right here in Melbourne! We believe customers have the right to know where their products come from.</p>
<h2 id=are-any-uggs-still-made-in-australia>Are any Uggs still made in Australia?</h2>
<p>Known as Deckers Outdoor Corporation, Deckers ‘UGG’ stores are dotted around the world, but none of their UGG boots are made in Australia. At UGG Since 1974, each and every pair we make has a ‘Made in Australia’ sew-in label.</p>
<h2 id=when-did-ugg-stop-using-ugg-australia>When did Ugg stop using Ugg Australia?</h2>
<p>New UGG boots do not say Australia on the label, but rather just UGG. Deckers bought UGG Australia in 1995 but dropped “Australia” in 2016. The Deckers-owned brand is now simply called UGG.</p>
<h2 id=whats-the-difference-between-ugg-and-ugg-australia>What’s the difference between Ugg and UGG Australia?</h2>
<p>In Australia and New Zealand, where “Ugg” is a generic term for the style of footwear, 702 registered trademarks include the term “Ugg” in various logos and designs. Ugg boots (sometimes called uggs) in Australia and New Zealand are a unisex style of sheepskin boot.</p>
<h2 id=who-owns-original-uggs-australia>Who owns original Uggs Australia?</h2>
<p>Deckers Brands<br>
UGG (yew-gee-gee) (formerly UGG Australia) is an American footwear company and a division of Deckers Brands. UGG is a registered trademark in the United States and over 130 other countries for footwear, as well as bags, clothing, outerwear, home goods and other products.</p>
<h2 id=who-owns-original-uggs-australia-1>Who owns original UGGs Australia?</h2>
<h2 id=can-i-exchange-my-old-uggs-for-new-ones>Can I exchange my old Uggs for new ones?</h2>
<p>We gladly accept returns from customers who purchased their UGG® product from a retailer other than <a href=http://www.ugg.com>www.ugg.com</a>, or the UGG® call center. We will process your return for an exchange or a site credit. We do not offer a refund for products not purchased directly from us. Items must be in new and unused condition.</p>
<h2 id=do-they-kill-the-sheep-to-make-uggs>Do they kill the sheep to make UGGs?</h2>
<p>UGG boots are made of shearling—yep, that’s skin with the fleece still attached, people! Every year, millions of sheep are castrated and parts of their tails are cut off—often without any painkillers—before they’re finally slaughtered for their skin, which is what UGG boots are made of.</p>
<h2 id=should-you-wear-socks-with-uggs>Should you wear socks with UGGs?</h2>
<p>“So should I wear socks with my UGG boots?” While this really comes down to personal preference, the answer from those of us in the know, is “no” – UGGs are designed to be worn without socks, and for good reason.</p>
<h2 id=why-do-surfers-wear-uggs>Why do surfers wear Uggs?</h2>
<p>The unisex sheepskin and fleece footware called UGG boots, or simply uggs, gained popularity in the 1960s when competitive surfers began wearing them. They were the perfect remedy for cold, numb, wet feet.</p>
<h2 id=where-do-they-make-the-ugg-boots-in-australia>Where do they make the UGG boots in Australia?</h2>
<p>The reality of these UGG boots is that they were constructed in China and were not in any way, Australian made UGG boots.</p>
<h2 id=who-was-the-inventor-of-the-ugg-boot>Who was the inventor of the UGG BOOT?</h2>
<p>Deckers claims uggs were created by Australian surfer Brian Smith, who started making the boots in Santa Monica, California, in 1978. The company declined to talk to the BBC.</p>
<h2 id=whats-the-difference-between-ugg-boots-and-ug-boots>What’s the difference between UGG boots and Ug Boots?</h2>
<p>It was a success. Within two and a half months the Trademark Office declared the terms “ugg boots”, “ug boots” and “ugh boots” as generic and could be used by anyone in Australia to refer to sheepskin boots, and that the trademark “ugh-boots” be removed from the Register.</p>
<h2 id=is-the-ugg-trademark-valid-outside-of-australia>Is the UGG trademark valid outside of Australia?</h2>
<p>Nevertheless, Deckers holds registrations for the UGG trademark in the United States, China and over 130 other countries. The validity of the UGG trademark outside of Australia has also been challenged, but courts have consistently upheld its validity.</p>
