<h2 id=why-are-tropical-rainforests-so-humid>Why are tropical rainforests so humid?</h2>
<p>In an average year the climate in a tropical rain forest is very humid because of all the rainfall. A tropical rainforest gets about 150 cm of rain per year. It gets lots of rain because it is very hot and wet in rain forests. The hotter the air, the more water vapor it can hold.</p>
<h2 id=does-a-tropical-rainforest-have-a-humid-climate>Does a tropical rainforest have a humid climate?</h2>
<p>Tropical rainforests are warm and humid—the temperature ranges from 21 to 30 degrees Celsius (70 to 85°F). The average annual temperature of tropical rainforests is above 20 °C. These areas often receive lots of sun due to their location around the earth’s equator.</p>
<h2 id=why-are-the-tropical-rainforest-very-dark-and-humid>Why are the tropical rainforest very dark and humid?</h2>
<p>The rainforest floor is often dark and humid due to constant shade from the canopy’s leaves. Despite its constant shade, the rainforest floor is an important part of the forest ecosystem. The forest floor is where decomposition takes place.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-temperature-like-in-tropical-rainforests>What is the temperature like in tropical rainforests?</h2>
<p>70 to 85°F<br>
Tropical rainforests are lush and warm all year long! Temperatures don’t even change much between night and day. The average temperature in tropical rainforests ranges from 70 to 85°F (21 to 30°C). The environment is pretty wet in tropical rainforests, maintaining a high humidity of 77% to 88% year-round.</p>
<h2 id=why-is-the-forest-floor-tends-so-dark>Why is the forest floor tends so dark?</h2>
<p>Answer: The rainforest floor is often dark and humid due to constant shade from the canopy’s leaves. Despite its constant shade, the rainforest floor is an important part of the forest ecosystem. The forest floor is where decomposition takes place.</p>
<h2 id=why-is-the-tropical-rainforest-hot-and-wet>Why is the tropical rainforest hot and wet?</h2>
<p>Since most rainforests are located near the equator, their climate is always hot, wet and humid. Temperatures in tropical rainforests do not change much.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-the-characteristics-of-a-humid-tropical-forest>What are the characteristics of a humid tropical forest?</h2>
<p>Despite having a soil lacking in nutrients, in the humid tropical forests grow and develop a large number – and variety – of trees and plants. Mainly, this is due to the action of mycorrhizae (fungi). The climate of the humid tropical forests is called tropical humid climate, and is characterized, among other things, by constant rainfall.</p>
<h2 id=how-is-the-climate-in-the-amazon-rainforest>How is the climate in the Amazon rainforest?</h2>
<p>Since most rainforests are located near the equator, their climate is always hot, wet and humid. Temperatures in tropical rainforests do not change much. The Amazon rainforest generally retains a temperature between 68 to 93 degrees Fahrenheit.</p>
<h2 id=how-often-does-it-rain-in-the-tropical-rainforest>How often does it rain in the tropical rainforest?</h2>
<p>It can rain more than 100 inches a year. Because the rainforest is so humid, steam raising from the ground is not uncommon, especially on those days when it’s not raining. The area is always wet, always humid. Temperatures can easily rise to the mid-90s (Fahrenheit), but because of the humidity, it feels much higher.</p>
