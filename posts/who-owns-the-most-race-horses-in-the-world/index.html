<h2 id=where-is-authentic-the-horse-now>Where is Authentic the horse now?</h2>
<p>Kentucky Derby and Breeders’ Cup Classic winner Authentic has been retired at the peak of his career and will be sent to Spendthrift Farm in Lexington, Ky., to start a career as a stallion. On Saturday, Authentic, a 3-year-old, won the Classic by 2¼ lengths, running against older horses.</p>
<h2 id=how-old-is-authentic>How old is Authentic?</h2>
<p>Lowered the 84-year-old track record at Keeneland in 1:59.60, breaking American Pharoah’s mark from the 2015 Breeders’ Cup Classic.</p>
<h2 id=is-monomoy-girl-retired>Is Monomoy girl retired?</h2>
<p>Presumably, she will be retired at the end of this year after the Breeders’ Cup and will settle in at Spendthrift, where she will be among the most valuable broodmares on the planet. That likely means that there are eight months left before she is done and eight months left to define her career.</p>
<h2 id=what-kind-of-horse-was-cajun-the-horse>What kind of horse was Cajun the horse?</h2>
<p>Background. Cajun was a chestnut horse with a small white star bred in Ireland by J A Dene and was described as a “well-made, attractive” colt with a “very smooth, daisy-cutting action”. He was from the first crop of foals sired by Red Regent, a well-traveled horse whose biggest wins came in the City and Suburban Handicap and…</p>
<h2 id=how-are-acadians-and-cajuns-related-in-louisiana>How are Acadians and Cajuns related in Louisiana?</h2>
<p>In Louisiana, Acadian and Cajun are often used as broad cultural terms without reference to actual descent from the deported Acadians. Historically, Louisianians of Acadian descent were also considered to be Louisiana Creoles, although Cajun and Creole are often portrayed as separate identities today.</p>
<h2 id=where-does-the-word-cajun-come-from-in-canada>Where does the word Cajun come from in Canada?</h2>
<p>Cajun refers to someone whose ancestors came from Acadia, a region that includes Prince Edward Island, Nova Scotia and New Brunswick. The British were in control of the area in the early 1700s, and during the French and Indian War, they were afraid the Acadians would rise and fight with the French.</p>
<h2 id=where-did-cajun-go-after-his-racing-career>Where did Cajun go after his racing career?</h2>
<p>At the end of his racing career Cajun was retired to become a breeding stallion at the Ashleigh Stud in County Dublin in 1983 but was exported to Japan a year later. He stood in Japan until 1995 but sired very few foals after 1991. The best of his offspring were the Grade 3 winners Tomoe Regent, Oratorio and Lincoln City.</p>
