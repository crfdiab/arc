<h2 id=what-are-the-4-active-volcanoes-in-italy>What are the 4 active volcanoes in Italy?</h2>
<p>Volcanoes of Italy – Vesuvius, Campi Flegrei, Etna, Stromboli, Lipri, Vulcano / VolcanoDiscovery.</p>
<h2 id=is-mt-etna-the-same-as-vesuvius>Is Mt Etna the same as Vesuvius?</h2>
<p>Etna covers an area of 1,190 km2 (459 sq mi) with a basal circumference of 140 km (87 miles). This makes it by far the largest of the three active volcanoes in Italy, being about two and a half times the height of the next largest, Mount Vesuvius.</p>
<h2 id=why-is-it-called-stromboli>Why is it called Stromboli?</h2>
<p>Stromboli is Italian-American. It originated in Philadelphia, from the depths of the Italian-heavy neighborhood of South Philly. It was named after the Italian Isle of Stromboli. Stromboli.</p>
<h2 id=is-the-etna-volcano-a-threat-to-italy>Is the Etna volcano a threat to Italy?</h2>
<p>Although the Etna appears to be fairly quiet at the moment, scientists expect the next major eruption of the Vesuvius – the very same volcano that destroyed Pompeii in ancient times – very soon. Although the six volcanoes in Italy pose a permanent threat for the population, the country also benefits from the geological faults.</p>
<h2 id=how-many-volcanoes-are-there-in-stromboli-italy>How many volcanoes are there in Stromboli Italy?</h2>
<p>It’s made up of a small group of islands that were formed by volcanic activity. This activity happened over a period of 250,000 years. There were eight islands that formed and two of them are considered to be active volcanoes. One of the best parts about Stromboli is the lava spurts that occur.</p>
<h2 id=where-are-the-three-active-volcanoes-in-italy>Where are the three active volcanoes in Italy?</h2>
<p>The three main active volcanoes in Italy are Etna, Stromboli and Vesuvius. Now let’s break them down. Mount Etna stands at 10,900 feet in elevation and is the highest active volcano in Europe. This mountain is located on the east coast of Sicily, Italy, between the cities of Messina and Catania.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-the-features-of-a-strombolian-volcano>What are the features of a strombolian volcano?</h2>
<p>Strombolian eruptions are relatively mild explosive activity consisting ofi ncandescent cinder, lapilli and lava bombs. A significant and spectacular geological feature of the volcano is the Sciara del Fuoco (“Stream of Fire”), a big horseshoe-shaped depression created in 13,000 years of eruptions and collapses on one side of the cone.</p>
