<h2 id=what-caused-the-desire-for-independence-in-latin-america>What caused the desire for independence in Latin America?</h2>
<p>The Peninsular War, which resulted from the Napoleonic occupation of Spain, caused Spanish Creoles in Spanish America to question their allegiance to Spain, stoking independence movements that culminated in the wars of independence, which lasted almost two decades.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-most-lasting-impact-of-the-latin-american-revolution>What was the most lasting impact of the Latin American Revolution?</h2>
<p>Immediate effects of the revolutions included freedom and independence for the people of the liberated countries. However, in the long term, poor governance of the liberated countries led to instability and increasing poverty in those areas.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-goal-of-the-latin-american-revolution>What was the goal of the Latin American Revolution?</h2>
<p>The main goal was to separate from the imperial powers and to become completely independent from Spain and Portugal. Along with this, the creation of new countries and a fairer social system were goals for Latin America.</p>
<h2 id=why-did-latin-america-gain-independence-from-spain>Why did Latin America gain independence from Spain?</h2>
<p>The independence of Latin America from Spain was a foregone conclusion as soon as the creoles began thinking of themselves as Americans and the Spaniards as something different from them. By that time, Spain was between a rock and a hard place: The creoles clamored for positions of influence in the colonial bureaucracy and for freer trade.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-cause-of-the-latin-american-revolution>What was the cause of the Latin American Revolution?</h2>
<p>The Haitian Revolution, a bloody but successful uprising of enslaved people against their French colonial enslavers (1791–1804), terrified landowners in the Caribbean and northern South America, and as the situation worsened in Spain, many feared that Spain could not protect them from a similar uprising.</p>
<h2 id=why-did-the-elites-of-latin-america-want-more-control>Why did the elites of Latin America want more control?</h2>
<p>One reason was that the elites of Latin America wanted more control over trade, taxes. Two, the elites who were of European and Spanish descent were often more conservative than the Spanish and didn’t want to liberalize in certain ways. Spain was changing politically was becoming more democratic and open. That’s not something they wanted per se.</p>
<h2 id=why-did-the-english-colonist-come-to-latin-america>Why did the English colonist come to Latin America?</h2>
<p>In cities throughout the region, Creole frustrations increasingly found expression in ideas derived from the Enlightenment. Imperial prohibitions proved unable to stop the flow of potentially subversive English, French, and North American works into the colonies of Latin America.</p>
