<h2 id=who-did-calamity-jane-kill>Who did Calamity Jane kill?</h2>
<p>Wild Bill<br>
One such story was her relationship with Western legend Hickok, whom she probably did meet in Deadwood. Their alleged dalliance launched her name into the annals of Western folklore. Even Jane herself, in her autobiography, spun a wild tale of capturing Jack McCall, after he murdered Wild Bill.</p>
<h2 id=was-calamity-jane-a-good-person>Was Calamity Jane a good person?</h2>
<p>“She has always been known for her friendliness, generosity and happy cordial manner. It didn’t matter to her whether a person was rich or poor, white or black, or what their circumstances were, Calamity Jane was just the same to all.</p>
<h2 id=was-calamity-jane-really-a-drunk>Was Calamity Jane really a drunk?</h2>
<p>Rather than being the dashing heroine of the printed page, Calamity Jane was loudmouthed and often drunk. In 1896 Calamity’s growing literary reputation catapulted her into the Kohl-Middleton Palace Museum Wild West show in Minneapolis. But her attachment to alcohol caused her stint to be short-lived.</p>
<h2 id=did-wild-bill-hickok-love-calamity-jane>Did Wild Bill Hickok love Calamity Jane?</h2>
<p>Calamity Jane was a frontierswoman known for her men’s attire, hard drinking, and skill at profanity. She claimed to have been in love with Wild Bill Hickok and even to have gone after his killer with a meat cleaver—though there is no evidence to support this; she is, however, buried near him, as she requested.</p>
<h2 id=was-charlie-utter-real-person>Was Charlie Utter real person?</h2>
<p>Charles H. “Colorado Charlie” Utter (14 Mar 1838 – 3 July 1915) was a figure of the American Wild West, best known as a great friend and companion of Wild Bill Hickok. He was also friends with Calamity Jane.</p>
<h2 id=did-doris-day-ride-the-horse-in-calamity-jane>Did Doris Day ride the horse in Calamity Jane?</h2>
<p>They grew up and hit Hollywood on horseback, doubling for stars such as Betty Hutton in “Perils of Pauline,” Barbara Stanwyck in “Maverick Queen,” Doris Day in “Calamity Jane” and Gail Davis in “Annie Oakley.” …</p>
<h2 id=why-did-calamity-jane-want-to-be-buried-next-to-wild-bill>Why did Calamity Jane want to be buried next to Wild Bill?</h2>
<p>She died a few years later. She’s buried next to Wild Bill Hickok at Mount Moriah Cemetery. It’s widely reported that Hickok, who was married, had little interest in Jane and that’s why the townsfolk buried her next to him so she could spend eternity with him and they could play the ultimate joke on Hickok.</p>
<h2 id=who-shot-charlie-utter>Who shot Charlie Utter?</h2>
<p>Jack McCall<br>
Attendance at the funeral was heavy, and Utter had Hickok buried with a wooden grave marker which read: “Wild Bill, J. B. Hickock killed by the assassin Jack McCall in Deadwood, Black Hills, August 2d, 1876.</p>

<h2 id=did-gail-davis-do-her-own-stunts-in-annie-oakley>Did Gail Davis do her own stunts in Annie Oakley?</h2>
<p>Actress Gail Davis, best known for her role as a gun-toting, pigtailed rancher in the popular 1950s television series “Annie Oakley,” has died of cancer. She was 71. A skilled rider and a crack shot, Davis appeared in several Gene Autry westerns and did most of her own stunt work.</p>
<h2 id=did-barbara-stanwyck-do-her-own-stunts>Did Barbara Stanwyck do her own stunts?</h2>
<p>At age 49, Stanwyck did all of her own stunts in this film, including being dragged down the street by a horse (a stunt her professional stunt woman refused to do).</p>
<h2 id=who-is-buried-in-mount-moriah>Who is buried in Mount Moriah?</h2>
<p>Mount Moriah Cemetery on Mount Moriah in Deadwood, Lawrence County, South Dakota is the burial place of Wild Bill Hickok, Calamity Jane, Seth Bullock and other notable figures of the Wild West.</p>
