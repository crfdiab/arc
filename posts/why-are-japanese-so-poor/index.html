<p>Loading… As it happens I currently live in one of Japan’s poorest, most “backwards” (this is an unfairly loaded term) regions, a small village in rural Iwate, one the largest, least populous, least prosperous mountainous wilderness prefectures in Japan.</p>
<h2 id=which-is-the-poorest-country-in-the-world>Which is the poorest country in the world?</h2>
<p>Japan’s 15.7% is above countries which have fewer resources and are less developed than Japan, namely, Slovak Republic (6.5%), Slovenia (7.2%), and Poland (10.1%) Poverty rate is increasing at an alarming rate of 1.3% in Japan, since 1985.</p>
