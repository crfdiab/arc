<h2 id=who-is-the-mother-of-missions>Who is the mother of missions?</h2>
<p>Known as the “Mother of the Missions,” San Diego Mission Church (San Diego de Alcala), a National Historic Landmark, was the first of 21 Spanish missions established, in part, by Father Junipero Serra. The mission was founded in 1769. The church burned during an Indian uprising in 1775.</p>
<h2 id=what-were-the-reasons-for-the-missions>What were the reasons for the missions?</h2>
<p>The California missions began in the late 18th century as an effort to convert Native Americans to Catholicism and expand European territory. Spain was responsible for the missions, which scholars believe were attempts to colonize the Pacific coast of North America.</p>
<h2 id=which-missionary-introduced-the-modern-era-of-missions>Which missionary introduced the modern era of missions?</h2>
<p>Carey, the first Baptist missionary of the modern era, arrived in colonial Calcutta in November 1793 without any travel permits.</p>
<h2 id=who-is-known-as-the-father-of-modern-missions>Who is known as the father of modern missions?</h2>
<p>Carey<br>
Carey is known as the “father of modern missions.” His essay, An Enquiry into the Obligations of Christians to Use Means for the Conversion of the Heathens, led to the founding of the Baptist Missionary Society.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-modern-missions>What are modern missions?</h2>
<p>HE Modern Missions Movement is a self-constituted. body of missionary supporters which proposes to. operate outside the official organizations, but neverthe- less within the total enterprise, functioning co-operatively with. other missionary bodies in so far as possible along the lines in-</p>
<h2 id=what-does-a-mother-of-a-missionary-do>What does a mother of a missionary do?</h2>
<p>A mother of a missionary knows the costs of surrender to participate in God’s mission. In prayer, she carries the weight of the Great Commission as her child carries his name to those who have never heard. A mother of a missionary treasures the sincere words from others who say, “I’m praying for your child.”</p>
<h2 id=why-is-it-important-to-support-the-work-of-missions>Why is it important to support the work of missions?</h2>
<p>Supporting the idea of missions and individual missionaries is important because it is God’s plan in this world to establish new churches and bring new believers to Christ through the work of missions.</p>
<h2 id=when-did-the-missionary-movement-start-in-europe>When did the missionary movement start in Europe?</h2>
<p>Similar groups formed in continental Europe and America, including the American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions (1810) and, among Baptists, the General Convention for Foreign Missions (1814). The missionary movement has not stopped growing since 1792.</p>
<h2 id=who-was-the-father-of-the-protestant-mission-movement>Who was the father of the Protestant mission movement?</h2>
<p>And he recognized the changing historical context that made a missionary movement possible. Careys call to mission launched a movement. More than any other individual, he moved European and North American churches to focus on the world beyond. For this reason he deserves to be called the Father of Protestant Missions.</p>
