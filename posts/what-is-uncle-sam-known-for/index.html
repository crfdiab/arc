<p>By 1900, through the efforts of Nast, Joseph Keppler, and others, Uncle Sam was firmly entrenched as the symbol for the U.S. One of the most familiar treatments in the 20th century was shown in James Montgomery Flagg ’s World War I recruiting poster, also used in World War II, for which the caption read, “I Want You.”.</p>
