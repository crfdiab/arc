<h2 id=is-timber-considered-renewable>Is timber considered renewable?</h2>
<p>Wood Is a Completely Renewable Resource When harvested properly, wood is much more sustainable than its metal alternatives. Materials like steel and aluminum also require a lot more energy to produce. Sustainable timber must be planted and harvested in very specific ways in order to retain its eco-friendly status.</p>
<h2 id=what-does-sustainable-mean-in-terms-of-renewable-timber>What does sustainable mean in terms of renewable timber?</h2>

<h2 id=why-do-we-use-sustainable-timber>Why do we use sustainable timber?</h2>
<p>Timber is not only a renewable and recyclable resource, but it is energy-efficient to produce. Importantly, timber acts as a carbon store, giving it an important role to play in reducing carbon emissions. Producing timber in a sustainable way requires long-term planning.</p>
<h2 id=is-hardwood-better-than-softwood>Is hardwood better than softwood?</h2>
<p>Because of their condensed and more complex structure, hardwoods generally offer a superior level of strength and durability. Hardwoods tend to be much more resilient than softwoods and are often reserved for projects that require maximum durability.</p>
<h2 id=is-roble-wood-sustainable>Is Roble wood sustainable?</h2>
<p>Sourced from environmentally managed forests in Bolivia, Roble is the same colour, weight, density and durability as Oak and Teak.

<h2 id=what-kind-of-energy-is-used-to-produce-timber>What kind of energy is used to produce timber?</h2>
<p>The energy consumed in producing timber (known as embodied energy) is very low when compared to other materials that society consumes.</p>
<h2 id=what-kind-of-timber-is-used-in-construction>What kind of timber is used in construction?</h2>
