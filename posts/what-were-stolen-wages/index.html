<h2 id=what-were-stolen-wages>What were stolen wages?</h2>
<p>From the late 1800s until the 1970s Aboriginal workers were for all intents and purposes enslaved. They were denied access to their wages which in many cases were simply stolen by corrupt officials and employers. It locked them into a cycle of poverty.</p>
<h2 id=how-much-does-australia-pay-to-aboriginal>How much does Australia pay to Aboriginal?</h2>
<p>Indigenous budget drivers In 2015–16, the Australian Government directly spent $14.7 billion on Indigenous people, of which 77 per cent ($11.3 billion) was through mainstream programs such as Medicare, social security payments, child care benefits and support for university places accessed by Indigenous people.</p>
<h2 id=where-did-the-stolen-wages-go>Where did the stolen wages go?</h2>
<p>The New South Wales Aboriginal Welfare Board is abolished. The trust accounts are closed down and the remaining funds transferred to the Department of Youth and Community Services.</p>
<h2 id=do-aboriginals-get-paid-more-centrelink>Do Aboriginals get paid more Centrelink?</h2>
<p>Individuals do not get extra funding because they are Indigenous. However, specific government programs, not additional income, have been introduced for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples because they are the most economically and socially disadvantaged group in Australia.</p>
<h2 id=when-did-aboriginal-australians-get-equal-pay>When did Aboriginal Australians get equal pay?</h2>
<p>1968<br>
The Aboriginal stockmen finally received equal pay in 1968, a year after the 1967 referendum amended the Constitution to finally include Aboriginal people in counts of Australia’s population.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-aboriginal-people-get-paid-in-western-australia>How did Aboriginal people get paid in Western Australia?</h2>
<p>Many Aboriginal people who worked for white people did not receive their wages directly. Their bosses only gave them ‘pocket money’ while from 1897 to the late 1970s their wages were ‘administered’ for them by government or police authorities [4]. In Western Australia wages were under “total government control”…</p>
<h2 id=how-much-money-was-stolen-from-aboriginal-people>How much money was stolen from Aboriginal people?</h2>
<p>Not every worker was affected though. Today we talk about ‘stolen wages’ because in many cases Aboriginal people did not receive parts or all of these wages. Historians estimate that the state of Queensland alone owes around $500 million to Aboriginal people [4]. Some individuals are owed close to half a million dollars in today’s terms [9].</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-value-of-stolen-wages-in-queensland>What was the value of stolen wages in Queensland?</h2>
<p>Stolen Wages were used to build Queensland – the Government owing to Indigenous people is now conservatively valued at $500 million dollars. For much of the last century, the Queensland Government controlled the lives of most Aboriginal people.</p>
<h2 id=how-much-money-is-owed-to-indigenous-people>How much money is owed to indigenous people?</h2>
<p>It has been estimated that $500 million is owed to Indigenous people in Queensland alone. This information has been sourced from Unfinished Business: Indigenous Stolen Wages, the report of the Inquiry into Stolen Wages by the Senate Legal and Constitutional References Committee in 2006.</p>
