<h2 id=what-direction-is-north-in>What direction is north in?</h2>
<p>North is one of the four compass points or cardinal directions. It is the opposite of south and is perpendicular to east and west.</p>
<h2 id=is-north-right-or-left-of-east>Is north right or left of east?</h2>
<p>By convention, the right hand side of a map is east. This convention has developed from the use of a compass, which places north at the top. However, on maps of planets such as Venus and Uranus which rotate retrograde, the left hand side is east.</p>
<h2 id=is-west-left-of-north>Is west left of north?</h2>
<p>In a map with north at the top, west is on the left.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-opposite-direction-of-north-west>What is the opposite direction of north west?</h2>
<p>East<br>
South: This is the direction that is the opposite of north. East: This is the direction that is the opposite of west.</p>
<h2 id=can-a-north-arrow-point-to-the-left>Can a north arrow point to the left?</h2>
<p>This is a good one, obviously if you are able to a North arrow should always point up on a drawing, but if due to orientation of the sheet or size of the building this cannot be achieved, should the arrow point to the left or the right? Does it matter, I need hard evidence to support this. This should be fun! drums please, Fab?</p>
<h2 id=is-the-southern-pole-of-a-compass-attracted-to-the-south>Is the southern pole of a compass attracted to the south?</h2>
<p>The southern pole of a compass is attracted to the south just as much as strongly as the northern one points north. yeah, we don’t actually point our maps that way, lb!</p>
<h2 id=why-are-drawings-oriented-with-south-up-and-south-down>Why are drawings oriented with South up and south down?</h2>
<p>Drawings are oriented with south up because the major work we are doing – kitchen renovation – is on the north side of the house. So the most “active” portion of the drawing is now at the bottom of the sheet. Which makes a little sense. Upstairs we are renovating the entire plan. The two sheets absolutely must be oriented the same way, obviously.</p>
<h2 id=why-do-i-have-to-face-north-up>Why do I have to face north up?</h2>
<p>The only reasons I would face north up is if that happened to be where it landed (because the front facade is the south facade), or because the building is not directly on a street AND does not have an obvious front or main facade, in which case north=up would be as sensible an organizational logic as any.</p>
