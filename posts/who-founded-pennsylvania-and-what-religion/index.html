<p>Its founder, English reformer William Penn, born on October 14, 1644, in London, England, named it in honor of his father. Persecuted in England for his Quaker faith, Penn came to America in 1682 and established Pennsylvania as a place where people could enjoy freedom of religion.</p>

<p>While English Quakers were the earliest settlers to take advantage of this liberal government, many other British immigrants also came to Pennsylvania seeking refuge from the religious persecution of Europe.</p>
<h2 id=who-was-the-religious-group-that-founded-pennsylvania>Who was the religious group that founded Pennsylvania?</h2>
<p>Answers. The Colony of Pennsylvania was founded by the Christian religious Movement the Quakers (they were characterized by having no priests, no leaders, etc‚Ä¶), and to be more exact, it was founded by William Penn, an English Philosopher, in 1681. Hope this helps! üôÇ</p>
<h2 id=why-are-there-so-many-ethnic-groups-in-pennsylvania>Why are there so many ethnic groups in Pennsylvania?</h2>
<p>The diversity of ancestries within this category is a reminder of the colony‚Äôs policy of religious tolerance that attracted a large number of immigrants. One of these groups, the Germans who settled in Pennsylvania and later adopted an identity as Pennsylvania Dutch, still maintain a strong cultural presence in the state.</p>
<h2 id=who-was-the-first-group-to-arrive-in-pennsylvania>Who was the first group to arrive in Pennsylvania?</h2>
<p>The first European settlers were Swedish Lutherans; German Lutherans began arriving 1703. William Penn brought the Quakers to Pennsylvania during the 1680s and the climate of religious liberty soon attracted other dissident groups, including German Mennonites, Dunkars, Moravians, and Schwenkfelders; French Huguenots;</p>
<h2 id=which-is-the-largest-religious-group-in-pittsburgh>Which is the largest religious group in Pittsburgh?</h2>
<p>The Gilded Age saw the founding of a new group in Pittsburgh by clergyman Charles Taze Russell; first called the Russellites, members of this group (established in 1872) are known today as Jehovah‚Äôs Witnesses. As of 2000, Roman Catholics constituted the largest religious group in the state, with a total membership of about of 3,802,524.</p>
