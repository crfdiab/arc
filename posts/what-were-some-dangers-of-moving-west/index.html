<p>Dangers on the Westward Trails</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Disease. By far, the most common cause of death along the westward trails was by disease.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Wagon Mishaps. Wagon crashes, particularly at river crossings were among the most common and deadly dangers that pioneers faced.</p>

<h2 id=weather-what-dangers-did-settlers-face-as-they-moved-west>Weather. What dangers did settlers face as they moved west?</h2>
<p>As settlers and homesteaders moved westward to improve the land given to them through the Homestead Act, they faced a difficult and often insurmountable challenge. The land was difficult to farm, there were few building materials, and harsh weather, insects, and inexperience led to frequent setbacks.</p>
<h2 id=why-was-the-journey-west-dangerous>Why was the journey west dangerous?</h2>
<p>Sandstorms were common crossing the plains. Also thunder storms, flooding or droughts could put a party in danger. Wagon trains could also be hit by disease. Cholera or typhus could strike and affected families would be left behind so as to not to spread the disease.</p>
<h2 id=which-were-dangers-pioneers-faced-when-moving-out-west>Which were dangers pioneers faced when moving out west?</h2>
<p>Obstacles included accidental discharge of firearms, falling off mules or horses, drowning in river crossings, and disease. After entering the mountains, the trail also became much more difficult, with steep ascents and descents over rocky terrain. The pioneers risked injury from overturned and runaway wagons.</p>
<h2 id=why-did-americans-feel-it-was-important-to-go-west>Why did Americans feel it was important to go west?</h2>
<p>To Jefferson, westward expansion was the key to the nation’s health: He believed that a republic depended on an independent, virtuous citizenry for its survival, and that independence and virtue went hand in hand with land ownership, especially the ownership of small farms.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-homesteaders-change-the-west>How did homesteaders change the West?</h2>
<p>The 1862 Homestead Act accelerated settlement of U.S. western territory by allowing any American, including freed slaves, to put in a claim for up to 160 free acres of federal land.</p>
<h2 id=why-did-settlers-move-west>Why did settlers move west?</h2>
<p>Pioneer settlers were sometimes pulled west because they wanted to make a better living. Others received letters from friends or family members who had moved west. These letters often told about a good life on the frontier. The biggest factor that pulled pioneers west was the opportunity to buy land.</p>
<h2 id=what-diseases-were-in-the-old-west>What diseases were in the Old West?</h2>
<p>Scarlet fever, yellow fever, diphtheria, smallpox, tuberculosis, and influenza attacked settlers along the westbound way. In addition to these scourges, fatalistically received as acts of God, there was violence, and the festering ills it trailed behind. Against such hazards there were few defenses.</p>
<h2 id=why-did-people-move-to-the-west-in-the-1800s>Why did people move to the west in the 1800s?</h2>
<p>Americans moved to the West in the 1800s because people wanted to own their own land and get a fresh start. Expansion also gave them new economic possibilities, such as farming and gold mining.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-most-dangerous-part-of-the-westward-expansion>What was the most dangerous part of the westward expansion?</h2>
<p>Dangers of Westward Expansion. Surprisingly the most dangerous part of moving west was not Indians, but rather something simple. Wagon wheels. The most reported deaths and injuries were because of people being run over by a wagon.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-people-get-from-east-to-west-during-the-westward-expansion>How did people get from east to West during the westward expansion?</h2>
<p>When you picture the “westward expansion” of settlers in the United States, a covered wagon may be the first thing to come to mind. Indeed, covered wagons, stage coaches and even boats were used to move people from east to west during the 19th century.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-people-travel-from-east-to-west-in-the-19th-century>How did people travel from east to West in the 19th century?</h2>
<p>Indeed, covered wagons, stage coaches and even boats were used to move people from east to west during the 19th century. However, a major feat of engineering and planning changed all of that for people traveling during the later part of the century.</p>
