<h2 id=what-did-ancient-chinese-poor-people-eat>What did ancient Chinese poor people eat?</h2>
<p>Poor People: Poor people of China had a boring diet. In north, people ate wheat in the form of dumplings, pancakes or noodles. While in south, staple food of people was rice. People who lived close to the river ate fish as well.</p>
<h2 id=what-do-traditional-chinese-eat>What do traditional Chinese eat?</h2>
<p>Staple Foods</p>
<ul>
<li>Rice is a major staple food in China.</li>
<li>Noodles are a basic staple food in China.</li>
<li>Tofu contains little fat and is high in protein, calcium, and iron.</li>
<li>Chinese people basically eat all animals’ meat, such as pork, beef, mutton, chicken, duck, pigeon, as well as many others.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id=did-ancient-chinese-eat-bread>Did ancient Chinese eat bread?</h2>
<p>By around 2500 BC, people in China started growing and eating wheat, having previously relied on imports from West Asia, and wheat quickly became the main source of carbohydrate. Ancient Chinese people ate porridge but they didn’t make wheat into bread.</p>
<h2 id=do-the-chinese-eat-lamb>Do the Chinese eat lamb?</h2>
<p>A lot of Chinese people are afraid of eating lamb because lamb is a quite strong flavour meat and a lot of Chinese people are afraid of that special lamb flavour. However in some places in China, local people absolutely adore eating lamb. Cities and regions include Xi’an, Xinjiang and most of Northern China.</p>
<h2 id=what-foods-did-the-ancient-chinese-eat-in-china>What foods did the ancient Chinese eat in China?</h2>
<p>Wheat did not reach China until 1500 B.C., when it was brought from western Asia by travelers. The ancient Chinese also ate soybeans, cucumbers, bok choy, ginger, oranges, lemons, peaches and apricots, all of which are native to China.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-chinas-most-popular-food>What is China’s most popular food?</h2>
<p>Rice is a major staple food in China. It is mainly grown in southern China. Chinese people eat rice almost every day for meals. People also use rice to produce wine and beer. It is one of the most popular foods in China and is used in many dishes. One of the most popular dishes is Yangzhou fried rice.</p>
<h2 id=what-do-people-in-china-eat-for-breakfast>What do people in China eat for breakfast?</h2>
<p>1. Fry the devils! Chinese oil stick, or youtiao, is a staple Chinese breakfast. When it first appeared, however, it appealed more to people’s hearts than their stomachs. Youtiao is also known in some areas across China as Youzhagui, or “fried devils.”</p>
<h2 id=what-foods-do-they-eat-in-chinese-medicine>What foods do they eat in Chinese medicine?</h2>
<p>Thus, one of the keys in Chinese medicine is to keep our body “neutral.” Foods that are warm and hot bring heat to our bodies — e.g. beef, coffee, ginger, hot chilies and fried foods — while cold and cool foods cool down our bodies– think of salad, cheese, green tea, and beer.</p>
