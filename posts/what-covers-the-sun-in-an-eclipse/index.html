<h2 id=what-covers-the-sun-in-an-eclipse>What covers the Sun in an eclipse?</h2>
<p>A total solar eclipse occurs when the Moon completely covers the Sun’s disk, as seen in this 1999 solar eclipse. In a total eclipse, the disk of the Sun is fully obscured by the Moon. In partial and annular eclipses, only part of the Sun is obscured.</p>
<h2 id=what-would-happen-to-solar-eclipses-if-the-moon-was-smaller>What would happen to solar eclipses if the Moon was smaller?</h2>
<p>If the Moon were slightly smaller or orbited a little farther away from Earth, it would never completely cover the solar disk. If the Moon were a little larger or orbited a bit closer to Earth, it would block much of the solar corona during totality, and eclipses wouldn’t be nearly as spectacular.</p>
<h2 id=what-kind-of-eclipse-happens-when-the-moon-covers-the-sun-but-is-too-small-to-completely-cover-it>What kind of eclipse happens when the Moon covers the Sun but is too small to completely cover it?</h2>
<p>Annular Eclipse: The Moon is at or near apogee, and so is too small to cover the Sun. The Moon’s umbra does not touch the Earth, so observer’s in the shadow path see the Sun as a ring (“annulus”).</p>
<h2 id=why-does-the-moon-block-the-sun-perfectly>Why does the moon block the Sun perfectly?</h2>
<p>The Sun is completely blocked in a solar eclipse because the Moon passes between Earth and the Sun. Even though the Moon is much smaller than the Sun, because it is just the right distance away from Earth, the Moon can fully blocks the Sun’s light from Earth’s perspective. This completely blocks out the Sun’s light.</p>
<h2 id=what-would-happen-if-the-moon-got-smaller>What would happen if the Moon got smaller?</h2>
<p>A less massive moon would also orbit closer to Earth than the real one. This makes it spiral a little farther outward with every orbit around Earth. (Each lunar revolution takes about 29.5 days). If the moon were half its mass, then the ocean tides would have been correspondingly smaller and imparted less energy to it.</p>
<h2 id=why-does-the-moon-cover-up-the-sun-during-a-solar-eclipse>Why does the moon cover up the sun during a solar eclipse?</h2>
<p>This means that from Earth, the Moon and the Sun appear to be roughly the same size in the sky. So, when the Moon comes between Earth and the Sun during a total solar eclipse, the Moon appears to completely cover up the light from the Sun. However, it won’t always be this way.</p>
<h2 id=how-are-lunar-eclipses-different-from-solar-eclipses>How are lunar eclipses different from solar eclipses?</h2>
<p>There are two types of eclipses on Earth: an eclipse of the moon and an eclipse of the sun. What Is a Lunar Eclipse? The moon moves in an orbit around Earth, and at the same time, Earth orbits the sun. Sometimes Earth moves between the sun and the moon. When this happens, Earth blocks the sunlight that normally is reflected by the moon.</p>
<h2 id=why-does-the-moon-appear-smaller-during-an-annular-solar-eclipse>Why does the Moon appear smaller during an annular solar eclipse?</h2>
<p>Annular Solar Eclipse An annular solar eclipse happens when the moon is farthest from the Earth, which is why it seems smaller. In this type of an eclipse, the moon does not block the sun…</p>
<h2 id=how-does-the-moon-and-sun-appear-to-be-the-same-size>How does the Moon and Sun appear to be the same size?</h2>
<p>This means that from Earth, the Moon and the Sun appear to be roughly the same size in the sky. Image credit: NASA So, when the Moon comes between Earth and the Sun during a total solar eclipse, the Moon appears to completely cover up the light from the Sun.</p>
