<h2 id=who-did-the-senate-censure-in-december-1954>Who did the Senate censure in December 1954?</h2>
<p>On December 2, 1954, the Senate voted to censure Senator Joseph McCarthy, who had led the fight in Congress to root out suspected Communists from the Federal Government. The censure described his behavior as “contrary to senatorial traditions.”</p>
<h2 id=what-does-it-mean-to-be-censured-by-the-senate>What does it mean to be censured by the Senate?</h2>
<p>Censure is a formal, and public, group condemnation of an individual, often a group member, whose actions run counter to the group’s acceptable standards for individual behavior. Members of Congress who have been censured are required to give up any committee chairs they hold.</p>
<h2 id=what-did-congress-decide-to-do-in-1954>What did Congress decide to do in 1954?</h2>
<p>The manifesto was signed by 19 US Senators and 82 Representatives from the South. The Manifesto was drafted to counter the landmark Supreme Court 1954 ruling Brown v. Board of Education, which determined that segregation of public schools was unconstitutional.</p>

<h2 id=why-was-senator-mccarthy-condemned-by-the-senate>Why was Senator McCarthy condemned by the Senate?</h2>
<p>McCarthy condemned by Senate. The U.S. Senate votes 65 to 22 to condemn Senator Joseph R. McCarthy for conduct unbecoming of a senator. The condemnation, which was equivalent to a censure, related to McCarthy’s controversial investigation of suspected communists in the U.S. government, military, and civilian society.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-cause-of-the-rise-of-mccarthyism>What was the cause of the rise of McCarthyism?</h2>
<p>Joseph McCarthy and the Rise of McCarthyism. At the time, McCarthy was a first-term senator from Wisconsin who had won election in 1946 after a campaign in which he criticized his opponent’s failure to enlist during World War II while emphasizing his own wartime heroics.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-mccarthyism-end-in-the-united-states>How did McCarthyism end in the United States?</h2>
<p>McCarthy, his credibility in tatters and now starved of witnesses, hit a brick wall—and his fellow senators turned against him. In early December 1954, the Senate passed a motion of condemnation, in a vote of 67 to 22. McCarthy was ruined—and within three years he was dead from alcohol abuse. The era of McCarthyism was over.</p>
<h2 id=what-did-senator-mccarthy-do-during-the-red-scare>What did Senator McCarthy do during the Red Scare?</h2>
<p>Joseph McCarthy. For many Americans, the most enduring symbol of this “Red Scare” was Republican Senator Joseph P. McCarthy of Wisconsin. Senator McCarthy spent almost five years trying in vain to expose communists and other left-wing “loyalty risks” in the U.S. government. In the hyper-suspicious atmosphere of the Cold War,…</p>
