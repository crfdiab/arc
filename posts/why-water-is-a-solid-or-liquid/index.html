<h2 id=why-water-is-a-solid-or-liquid>Why water is a solid or liquid?</h2>
<p>Under standard atmospheric conditions, water exists as a liquid. But if we lower the temperature below 0 degrees Celsius, or 32 degrees Fahrenheit, water changes its phase into a solid called ice. A molecule of water vapor has the same chemical composition, H2O, as a molecule of liquid water or a molecule of ice.</p>
<h2 id=why-is-liquid-not-water>Why is liquid not water?</h2>
<p>Every pure element in liquid form does not have water. Bromine and mercury are liquids are room temperature and, when pure, have no water in them. Pure solvents and compounds (other than water) have no water.</p>
<h2 id=is-all-water-liquid>Is all water liquid?</h2>
<p>One of the most basic things we are taught in school science classes is that water can exist in three different states, either as solid ice, liquid water, or vapor gas. At lower temperatures, the molecules have a more limited number of configurations and so form a more ordered phase (a liquid).</p>
<h2 id=is-water-the-only-pure-liquid>Is water the only pure liquid?</h2>
<p>liquid state On Earth, water is the most abundant liquid, although much of the water with which organisms come into contact is not in pure form but is a mixture in which various substances are dissolved.</p>
<h2 id=is-glass-a-liquid>Is glass a liquid?</h2>
<p>Glass, however, is actually neither a liquid—supercooled or otherwise—nor a solid. With a “solid—if you grab it, it holds its shape,” he adds. When glass is made, the material (often containing silica) is quickly cooled from its liquid state but does not solidify when its temperature drops below its melting point.</p>
<h2 id=why-is-water-considered-to-be-an-ideal-liquid>Why is water considered to be an ideal liquid?</h2>
<p>No real liquid is ideal or is considered to be such. An ideal fluid is a fluid that has several properties including the fact that it is 1.incompressible – the density is constant 2.Irrotational – the flow is smooth, no turbulence 3.Nonviscous – (Inviscid) fluid has no internal friction ( η = 0)</p>
<h2 id=when-does-water-become-solid-is-it-a-liquid-or-a-solid>When does water become solid is it a liquid or a solid?</h2>
<p>Water is a liquid, so it does not meet requirement #3 – being a solid. However, at temperatures below 32 degrees Fahrenheit or 0 degrees Celsius, water becomes the solid material that we call “ice.” Crystal structure of ice: Photograph of a snowflake that reveals the hexagonal crystalline structure of ice.</p>
<h2 id=why-is-water-called-a-wonder-liquid-brainly>Why is water called a wonder liquid-Brainly?</h2>
<p>Water is the necessity of life, without water survival of living things is impossible. Water is universal solvent as it can dissolves majority of substance in it. Water comes on second no. after oxygen for maintaining life. Nearly 60% of our body is made up of water, so we need to maintain the metabolic activities and building body tissues.</p>
<h2 id=why-is-water-so-essential-for-living-things>Why is water so essential for living things?</h2>
<p>In this regard, water is essential simply because it’s a liquid at Earth-like temperatures. Because it flows, water provides an efficient way to transfer substances from a cell to the cell’s environment. By contrast, deriving energy from a solid is a much tougher prospect (though there are microbes that eat rock), Glazer said.</p>
