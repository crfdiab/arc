<h2 id=what-was-the-name-of-sir-john-hawkins-ship>What was the name of Sir John Hawkins ship?</h2>
<p>John Hawkins and the Spanish Armada The battle consisted of several engagements, during which Rear-Admiral Hawkins’ ship, the Victory, overpowered several Spanish vessels, and Vice-Admiral Drake, on Revenge, captured Rosario, a Spanish galleon.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-name-of-the-boat-that-brought-the-slaves>What was the name of the boat that brought the slaves?</h2>
<p>Clotilda<br>
The schooner Clotilda smuggled African captives into the U.S. in 1860, more than 50 years after importing slaves was outlawed.</p>
<h2 id=where-did-most-slaves-in-alabama-come-from>Where did most slaves in Alabama come from?</h2>
<p>Most of Alabama’s antebellum-era settlers originated from areas such as eastern Georgia and western South Carolina. Many of these settlers, who owned slaves before their move to Alabama, came in search of cheap, productive land on which to grow cotton.</p>
<h2 id=why-did-john-hawkins-name-his-ship-jesus>Why did John Hawkins name his ship Jesus?</h2>
<p>After Columbus’ findings, a European Christian named John Hawkins sought to make a profit by trading slaves. He had a ship named “Jesus of Lubeck” which he used to transport slaves that he says he obtained “partly by the sword and partly by other means” into the Americas to trade with the Spaniards.</p>
<h2 id=what-did-sir-john-hawkins-do-for-the-navy>What did Sir John Hawkins do for the Navy?</h2>
<p>Sir John Hawkins. In 1577 Hawkins succeeded his father-in-law, Benjamin Gonson, as treasurer of the navy; later (1589) he was to assume the additional duties of controller. His high naval post enabled him to direct the rebuilding of the older galleons and to contribute to the design of faster, more heavily armed ships.</p>
<h2 id=when-did-john-hawkins-go-on-his-first-voyage>When did John Hawkins go on his first voyage?</h2>
<p>In 1564, Queen Elizabeth I invested in Hawkins by leasing the old 700-ton ship Jesus of Lübeck, on which he set forth on a more extensive voyage, along with three small ships. Hawkins sailed with his second cousin, Francis Drake, to the west African coast, privateering along the way.</p>
<h2 id=where-did-sir-john-hawkins-sell-his-slaves>Where did Sir John Hawkins sell his slaves?</h2>
<p>After selling the slaves in the Caribbean, Hawkins was forced by needed repairs and lack of water to take refuge at San Juan de Ulua, near Veracruz, Mex. A Spanish fleet attacked him in the harbour, and, of the six ships, only the two commanded by Hawkins and Drake were able to escape.</p>
