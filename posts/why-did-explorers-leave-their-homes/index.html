<h2 id=why-did-explorers-leave-their-homes>Why Did explorers leave their homes?</h2>
<p>Many fled political and religious persecution. Others hoped to improve their condition by owning their own land or by participating in the fur trade. Some came as servants. Reports from New Netherland were so favorable that it seemed worth the risk of sailing to the New World.</p>
<h2 id=what-caused-explorers-to-venture>What caused explorers to venture?</h2>
<p>There are three main reasons for European Exploration. Them being for the sake of their economy, religion and glory. They wanted to improve their economy for instance by acquiring more spices, gold, and better and faster trading routes.</p>
<h2 id=why-do-people-want-to-be-an-explorer>Why do people want to be an explorer?</h2>
<p>In asking questions, Explorers raise awareness about issues and causes. In trumpeting the answers they find, or the process of finding even half the answer, they shine light on new understandings and discoveries. In doing so, they inspire us to become explorers by asking questions of our own. In short, explorers are educators.</p>
<h2 id=why-are-there-places-that-need-to-be-explored>Why are there places that need to be explored?</h2>
<p>Explain to students that there is a place far from people, barely explored, and full of danger, that needs to be explored now because the risk is that it will soon be lost. There are places about 60 miles from Florida, on the islands called the Bahamas that fit this description—places called “blue holes.”</p>
<h2 id=how-are-reasons-for-exploration-have-changed-over-time>How are reasons for exploration have changed over time?</h2>
<p>Explain that it is now important to discuss how explorations have changed over time because exploration has continually shaped our world (e.g., spice routes and connecting cultures). Ask students: How might reasons for exploration have changed over time? What ways do you think exploration has shaped our world?</p>
<h2 id=why-do-scientists-and-explorers-go-on-expeditions>Why do scientists and explorers go on expeditions?</h2>
<p>With an expedition, scientists or explorers have some background knowledge but seek evidence, or data, to help in answering specific questions. Expeditions also require substantial planning to ensure they are able to achieve this purpose.) Have students share their ideas with the class.</p>
