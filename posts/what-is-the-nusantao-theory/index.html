<h2 id=what-is-the-nusantao-theory>What is the Nusantao theory?</h2>
<p>Nusantao is an artificial term coined by Solheim, derived from the Austronesian root words nusa “south” and tao “man, people”. Solheim’s theory is an alternative hypothesis to the spread of the Austronesian language family in Southeast Asia. Solheim first suggested the concept in 1964.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-austronesian-theory>What is the Austronesian theory?</h2>
<p>The Austronesian Expansion Theory (also known as the Austronesian Migration Theory) suggests that the growth of the population of the Philippines is a result of a group of people from Asia known as the Austronesians.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-bellwood-theory>What is Bellwood theory?</h2>
<p>Bellwood (1995) contends that the ancestors of the Austronesian speakers spread from Yunnan in the south Chinese mainland and that as early as 6,000 BC a fishing gardening culture existed on the south coast of China, exploiting the waters off the straits of Taiwan, where eventually between 4,000 and 3,000 BC they …</p>
<h2 id=what-is-out-of-taiwan-theory>What is out of Taiwan theory?</h2>
<p>In 1983, Australian archaeologist Peter Bellwood gave a speech at the National Museum of Prehistory in Taitung, where he first proposed the “Out of Taiwan” theory which postulates that Taiwan is the origin of many of today’s Pacific islanders based on carbon dating of materials used by Austronesians, such as pottery.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-island-origin-theory>What is Island origin theory?</h2>
<p>The Island Origin Hypothesis by Wilhelm Solheim suggests that the language originated in the islands of northern Indonesia and Mindanao and then spread northwards. This suppression of literacy in the language of the administration kept the inhabitants in ignorance and in subservience for more than 300 years.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-the-theories-of-the-peopling-of-the-philippines>What are the theories of the peopling of the Philippines?</h2>
<p>Wilhelm Solheim’s Nusantao hypothesis was an alternative theory that focused on the maritime nature of the peopling of the Philippines and Southeast Asia, rather than following a ‘primacy’ of linguistics and agricultural methods.</p>
<h2 id=where-is-austronesia>Where is Austronesia?</h2>
<p>The Austronesian peoples, also sometimes referred to as the Austronesian-speaking peoples, are a large group of various peoples in Taiwan (collectively known as Taiwanese indigenous peoples), Maritime Southeast Asia, Oceania and Madagascar that speak the Austronesian languages.</p>
<h2 id=what-does-a-red-putong-mean>What does a red Putong mean?</h2>
<p>Putong. A piece of cloth worn around the head. Red putong means a man who had hia first kill. Embroidered putong means a man has killed sevwn or more enemies.</p>
<h2 id=what-countries-speak-austronesian>What countries speak Austronesian?</h2>
<p>Austronesian languages, formerly Malayo-Polynesian languages, family of languages spoken in most of the Indonesian archipelago; all of the Philippines, Madagascar, and the island groups of the Central and South Pacific (except for Australia and much of New Guinea); much of Malaysia; and scattered areas of Vietnam.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-core-population-theory>What is core population theory?</h2>
<p>The Core Population Theory states that there is an original Filipino race withinthe Philippines. This theory opposes Otley Bayer’s migration theory, which states thatthe Filipino race originated from the successful waves of migration from the Aetas,Indonesians and the Malays.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-the-nusantao-culture-spread-to-the-philippines>How did the Nusantao culture spread to the Philippines?</h2>
<p>Solheim stresses that the spread of language and culture in the aforementioned areas was not a product of migration but a product of years of trading – the Nusantao Maritime Trading and Communication Network.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-origin-of-the-nusantao-network>What was the origin of the Nusantao network?</h2>
<p>The Nusantao Maritime Trading and Communication Network started, as Solheim thought, in 5000 B.C. He suggested four lobes dividing parts of East Asia, Southeast Asia and Oceania – the Eastern Lobe, the Central Lobe, The Northern Lobe and the Southern Lobe. All of these lobes’ point of origin is the Central Lobe.</p>
<h2 id=where-does-the-name-nusantao-come-from-solheim>Where does the name Nusantao come from Solheim?</h2>
<p>The Nusantao Maritime Trading and Communication Network is something that Solheim has been thinking through since the 1960s – aside from his Sa-Huynh Kalanay complex. First off – what the heck does Nusantao mean? It was derived by the linguist George Grace from the root words “Nusa” which means “South” and “Tau” which means “Human”.</p>
<h2 id=who-are-the-austronesians-the-nusantao-and-the-lapita>Who are the Austronesians, the Nusantao and the Lapita?</h2>
<p>Austronesian speakers and more importantly with the Lapita cultural complex. These co ntained culture of the Taipei basin, and the Beinan culture of southeastern Taiwan. Oceania, specificall y the western Pacific, at around 3500 to 2900 years ago. It was named after its Hiscock 2005).</p>
