<h2 id=how-long-do-you-have-to-wait-to-get-your-record-expunged-in-ca>How long do you have to wait to get your record expunged in CA?</h2>
<p>You may apply for expungement the day after your probation ends. Many people think there is a “waiting period” for expungement. This only applies to convictions with NO probation; (often called a “terminal disposition” by criminal lawyers) then you must wait one year from the conviction to expunge the case.</p>
<h2 id=is-dismissed-the-same-as-expunged>Is dismissed the same as expunged?</h2>
<p>If your case is dismissed, your record will show that the charges were brought, but that they were later dropped. An expungement is when the record of your arrest, and your subsequent criminal case, are destroyed and any public access to this information is eliminated.</p>
<h2 id=how-far-back-does-a-live-scan-background-check-go-in-california>How far back does a Live Scan background check go in California?</h2>
<p>seven years<br>
How Far Back do Employment Background Checks go in California? In California, criminal convictions can only be reported for seven years.</p>
<h2 id=do-expunged-records-show-up-on-background-checks>Do expunged records show up on background checks?</h2>
<p>Expunged charges are erased from the record entirely, and sealed records still exist but are inaccessible to the public. Generally, sealed and expunged records will never appear on a background check.</p>
<h2 id=can-a-felon-get-their-gun-rights-back-in-california>Can a felon get their gun rights back in California?</h2>
<p>In general, a conviction for any felony offense will result in a lifetime ban on your ability to possess or own a gun. Based on our experience, only a pardon from the governor of California is effective at restoring your pardon under federal law as a pardon renders the conviction a legal nullity.</p>
<h2 id=is-it-possible-to-expunge-a-criminal-record-in-california>Is it possible to expunge a criminal record in California?</h2>
<p>Although true expungement does not exist in California, there may be options to clean your record depending on your situation. The law related to cleaning your record is complicated. If you ever get stuck, consider getting legal help. Not a U.S. citizen?</p>
<h2 id=what-happens-to-a-criminal-case-when-it-is-expunged>What happens to a criminal case when it is expunged?</h2>
<p>Instead, with an expungement, your guilty plea or conviction is withdrawn and replaced with a permanent non-guilty plea. Then, the case is dismissed. In other words, an expungement process makes it seem as if a conviction never took place. That said, while state courts grant many expungements each year, not all convictions qualify.</p>
<h2 id=can-a-criminal-record-be-dismissed-in-california>Can a criminal record be dismissed in California?</h2>
<p>You were convicted of an infraction or a misdemeanor and received a sentence other than probation. You may petition for a dismissal if you were convicted of an infraction or a misdemeanor and were sentenced to anything other than probation.</p>
<h2 id=when-to-apply-for-expungement-in-san-diego-county>When to apply for expungement in San Diego County?</h2>
<p>· You were convicted of a misdemeanor and denied probation or you were convicted of an infraction. o You must wait for one year after your conviction before applying for dismissal/expungement. o You cannot be on probation or other type of supervision or be serving a sentence for any other case.</p>
