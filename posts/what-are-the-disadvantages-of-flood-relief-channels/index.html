<h2 id=what-are-the-disadvantages-of-flood-relief-channels>What are the disadvantages of flood relief channels?</h2>
<p>Disadvantages: It can be hard find land to build relief channels, they are expensive and when empty can become areas to dump rubbish, etc. If river levels rise significantly it is also possible for relief channels to flood as well.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-disadvantages-of-flood>What are disadvantages of flood?</h2>
<p>Floods have large social consequences for communities and individuals. As most people are well aware, the immediate impacts of flooding include loss of human life, damage to property, destruction of crops, loss of livestock, and deterioration of health conditions owing to waterborne diseases.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-the-advantages-and-disadvantages-of-washlands>What are the advantages and disadvantages of washlands?</h2>
<p>Washland and Water Meadows Advantages: Habitats for animals provided, improved agricultural land, low maintainance. Disadvantages: Land cant be used during flooding events. Example: The River Trent UK, the washlands are exceptional grazing areas for sheep.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-flood-relief-channel>What is the flood relief channel?</h2>
<p>Flood relief channels are man-made channels that are created to divert water around or from important locations if a river is at risk of flooding. River discharge is reduced which means the risk of flooding is decreased. There will be an increased risk of flooding where the flood relief channel re-joins the river.</p>
<h2 id=how-is-flooding-managed>How is flooding managed?</h2>
<p>Floods can be controlled by redirecting excess water to purpose-built canals or floodways, which in turn divert the water to temporary holding ponds or other bodies of water where there is a lower risk or impact to flooding.</p>
<h2 id=are-there-any-benefits-of-floods>Are there any benefits of floods?</h2>
<p>Inundation of the flood plains helps recharge the groundwater, which is an important source of drinking water and is essential for agriculture. They are an important source for restocking local man-made water sources such as ponds, reservoirs, dams and irrigation channels, meeting round-the-year demand.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-the-advantages-of-flood-warnings>What are the advantages of flood warnings?</h2>
<p>Flood warning is the provision of advance warning of conditions that are likely to cause flooding to property and a potential risk to life. The main purpose of flood warning is to save life by allowing people, support and emergency services time to prepare for flooding.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-the-disadvantages-of-river-flood-prevention>What are the disadvantages of River flood prevention?</h2>
<p>Disadvantages 1 Looks unnatural and reduces access to the river. 2 Water speeds up and can increase flood risk downstream. More …</p>
<h2 id=what-can-be-done-to-prevent-flooding-in-drainage-basins>What can be done to prevent flooding in drainage basins?</h2>
<p>Can also be temporary structures where flood gates or removable ‘stoplogs’ are built to protect a stretch of river. Artificial levees can be built along river banks so that if the river floods, the water will not be able to breach the wall and cause damage.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-the-benefits-of-afforestation-in-flood-prevention>What are the benefits of afforestation in flood prevention?</h2>
<p>Afforestation involves planting trees in the river valley to intercept rain water and reduce surface run-off. Provides economic benefits, ie forestry. Provides new ecological habitats. Reduces farmland. Allows some parts of a river valley to flood naturally. Protects nearby towns from flooding. Provides new freshwater habitats.</p>
<h2 id=how-are-embankments-used-to-prevent-river-flooding>How are embankments used to prevent river flooding?</h2>
<p>Embankments raise the banks of a river so that it can hold more water. Cheap with a one-off cost. Allow for flood water to be contained within the river, protecting particular areas of high value from flooding. Looks unnatural and reduces access to the river. Water speeds up and can increase flood risk downstream.</p>
