<h2 id=what-2-countries-came-from-czechoslovakia>What 2 countries came from Czechoslovakia?</h2>
<p>On January 1, 1993, Czechoslovakia separated peacefully into two new countries, the Czech Republic and Slovakia.</p>
<h2 id=what-countries-did-the-former-czechoslovakia-split-into>What countries did the former Czechoslovakia split into?</h2>
<p>Against the wishes of many of its 15 million citizens, Czechoslovakia today split into two countries: Slovakia and the Czech Republic.</p>
<h2 id=why-did-czechoslovakia-split-into-2-countries>Why did Czechoslovakia split into 2 countries?</h2>
<p>Why Did Czechoslovakia Split? On January 1,1993, Czechoslovakia split into the nations of Slovakia and the Czech Republic. The separation was peaceful and came as a result of nationalist sentiment in the country. The act of tying the country together was considered to be too expensive a burden.</p>
<h2 id=what-two-countries-were-formed-out-of-czechoslovakia-during-the-velvet-divorce-in-1993>What two countries were formed out of Czechoslovakia during the Velvet Divorce in 1993?</h2>
<p>On January 1, 1993, Czechoslovakia split into two independent states, the Czech Republic and Slovakia, in what is now known as the “Velvet divorce” (in a reference to the Velvet revolution) due to its peaceful and negotiated nature. Both countries divided their common “goods” (embassies, military equipment, etc.)</p>
<h2 id=why-did-czechoslovakia-change-its-name>Why did Czechoslovakia change its name?</h2>
<p>The Czech Republic wants to be known as “Czechia” to make it easier for companies and sports teams to use it on products and clothing. The country will retain its full name but Czechia will become the official short geographic name, as “France” is to “The French Republic”.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-czechoslovakia-called-before-1918>What was Czechoslovakia called before 1918?</h2>
<p>1, 1993. Czechoslovakia itself had been formed at the end of World War I, following the collapse of the Austro-Hungarian Empire. Prior to the war the region consisted of Bohemia and Moravia, often called the Czech Lands, in the west, and Slovakia, a part of Hungary, in the east.</p>
<h2 id=why-is-it-called-velvet-divorce>Why is it called Velvet Divorce?</h2>
<p>It is sometimes known as the Velvet Divorce, a reference to the bloodless Velvet Revolution of 1989, which had led to the end of the rule of the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia.</p>
<h2 id=why-is-czech-not-called-bohemia>Why is Czech not called Bohemia?</h2>
<p>The name Bohemia was rejected because it explicitly excluded Moravia and Czech Silesia in the east of the country. “Czechia sounds too eastern. It’s not a good sound for a western country.”</p>
<h2 id=what-are-the-two-countries-that-split-czechoslovakia>What are the two countries that split Czechoslovakia?</h2>
<h2 id=when-did-czechoslovakia-break-away-from-nazi-germany>When did Czechoslovakia break away from Nazi Germany?</h2>
<p>It was occupied by Nazi Germany in 1938–45 and was under Soviet domination from 1948 to 1989. On January 1, 1993, Czechoslovakia separated peacefully into two new countries, the Czech Republic and Slovakia.</p>
<h2 id=who-was-the-leader-of-czechoslovakia-in-1992>Who was the leader of Czechoslovakia in 1992?</h2>
<p>Though the countries were created in a similar way after World War I, they ended up very differently. In Moravia on August 26, 1992, the Czech and Slovak premiers, Vaclav Klaus and Vladimir Meciar, respectively, stood before the press and declared that Czechoslovakia would become two independent states.</p>
<h2 id=when-was-the-czech-republic-and-slovakia-founded>When was the Czech Republic and Slovakia founded?</h2>
<p>On January 1, 1993 the Czech Republic and Republic of Slovakia were founded in peace. Czechoslovakia is not easy to pronounce in English (“CHEK” + “oh” + “sluh” + “VAK” + “ee” + “uh”), and has a long, interesting history.</p>
