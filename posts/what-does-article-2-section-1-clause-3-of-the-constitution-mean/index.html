<h2 id=what-does-article-2-section-1-clause-3-of-the-constitution-mean>What does Article 2 Section 1 Clause 3 of the Constitution mean?</h2>
<p>Clause 3: The electors meet in their states and vote for two people. At least one person for whom they vote cannot live in that elector’s state. The Electors will make a list of all the people they voted for, and how many votes each person got.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-purpose-of-article-2-section-1-clause-7>What is the purpose of Article 2 Section 1 Clause 7?</h2>
<p>The President shall, at stated Times, receive for his Services, a Compensation, which shall neither be encreased nor diminished during the Period for which he shall have been elected, and he shall not receive within that Period any other Emolument from the United States, or any of them.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-the-duties-and-powers-of-the-vice-president>What are the duties and powers of the vice president?</h2>
<p>One of the most important powers of the Vice President is the duty to preside over the Senate. While the Vice President does not get a vote, except in the event of a tie, they can preside over debate and overseeing operations.</p>
<h2 id=how-is-the-office-of-the-vice-president-established>How is the Office of the vice president established?</h2>
<p>The office of Vice President of the United States is established along with the office of President of the United States in Article II, Section 1 of the U.S. Constitution, which also creates and designates the Electoral College system as the method by which both offices are to be filled.</p>
<h2 id=can-a-vice-president-be-the-chairman-of-the-council-of-states>Can a vice president be the chairman of the Council of States?</h2>
<p>Provided that during any period when the Vice-President acts as President or discharges the functions of the President under article 65, he shall not perform the duties of the office of Chairman of the Council of States and shall not be entitled to any salary or allowance payable to the Chairman of the Council of States under article 97.</p>
<h2 id=how-does-the-vice-president-influence-the-senate>How does the vice president influence the Senate?</h2>
<p>While the Senate’s supermajority vote rules have reduced the impact of this power, the vice president can still influence legislation. As president of the Senate, the vice president is assigned by the 12th Amendment to preside over the joint session of Congress in which the votes of the Electoral College are counted and reported.</p>
