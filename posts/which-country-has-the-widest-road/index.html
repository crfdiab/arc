<p>The US boasts the world’s largest road network, followed by China and India, the world’s two most populous countries. Roadtraffic-technology.com profiles the ten biggest road networks in the world based on total road length.</p>
<h2 id=how-are-the-roads-in-thailand>How are the roads in Thailand?</h2>
<p>In Thailand, one of the world’s most unequal societies, even roads have a rigid hierarchy, with the poor far more likely to be killed in accidents than the well-off and well-connected. The government vowed at a United Nations forum in 2015 to halve the number of road traffic deaths by 2020.</p>
<h2 id=why-is-thailand-traffic-so-bad>Why is Thailand traffic so bad?</h2>
<p>What is the major cause of Bangkok’s traffic problems? For starters, there are too many vehicles which automatically leads to congestion on our roads. Other hindrances include poor road conditions and heavy rain. But another significant problem that worsens traffic is bad driving habits.</p>
<h2 id=how-dangerous-is-it-to-drive-in-thailand>How dangerous is it to drive in Thailand?</h2>
<p>Thailand’s provincial roads are the most dangerous with a death rate of 72 deaths per thousand in Rayong province while Bangkok’s roads, at most times a traffic log jam, are the safest. It appears to many observers that the dangers faced on Thailand’s roads are very much a Thai cultural aberration.</p>

<p>In addition to the failure to wear helmets and seatbelts, speeding, drunk driving, and a lack of restraints for children are among the biggest risks to road safety. “We need to change the DNA (of the country) and our instinct to follow the laws,” Nikorn said. “Education on law enforcement is the key.</p>
<h2 id=which-is-the-best-way-to-drive-in-thailand>Which is the best way to drive in Thailand?</h2>
<p>Take care on Thai roads, since speeding is a serious problem, and it causes a lot of accidents. The motorway network is largely concentrated in the Bangkok area and most of these roads are toll roads, however the tolls are very (20-40 baht per section). They are definitely worth paying to avoid the traffic jams.</p>

<p>Public highways ( ทางหลวง, thang luang) are also called public roads ( ถนนหลวง, thanon luang ), especially when part of urban streets. The network spans over 70,000 kilometers across all regions of Thailand. Most are single carriageways. Dual carriageways have frequent u-turn lanes and intersections slowing down traffic.</p>
