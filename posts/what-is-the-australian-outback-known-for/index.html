<h2 id=what-is-the-australian-outback-known-for>What is the Australian outback known for?</h2>
<p>The Great Sandy Desert is one such part of the Outback. Maps of this land sometimes designate areas as lakes, but many such lakes are dry. In Australia’s Northern Territory lies Uluru, also known as Ayers Rock. Uluru, a UNESCO World Heritage site, might be the world’s largest monolith.</p>

<li>Uluru is taller than the Eiffel Tower.</li>
<li>There are only 0.16 people per square kilometre in the Northern Territory.</li>
<li>There are over 150 different Indigenous languages spoken across Central Australia.</li>
<li>The most commonly seen Mammal isn’t native to the country.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id=what-defines-the-outback>What defines the outback?</h2>
<p>Outback, in Australia, any inland area remote from large centres of population. Generally, the term is applied to semiarid inland areas of eastern Australia and to the arid centre of the Western Plateau and its semiarid northern plains (in Western Australia) where bodies of water are scattered and frequently dry.</p>

<p>And last but not least there is the real heart of the site: hundreds of pages that cover different destinations in the Australian Outback ( outback towns, Australian tourist attractions, Australian national parks ). Now, I realise that this is all a bit overwhelming, and that’s why I have created a FREE Outback Travel Guidebook to get you started.</p>
<h2 id=what-kind-of-animals-are-found-in-the-outback-of-australia>What kind of animals are found in the outback of Australia?</h2>
<p>The reason kangaroo is one of the most popular Australian Outback animals found in the opal fields is that they easily withstand the dry climate. Additionally, their fast movements enable them to quickly traverse across the Outback in search of food and water. You’ll find a vast population of lizards in the Outback, starting with the Sand Goanna.</p>
<h2 id=why-are-so-many-people-dying-in-the-australian-outback>Why are so many people dying in the Australian outback?</h2>
<p>It’s as simple as that. Remote Australian Outback tracks are obviously not policed in any way. The great distances tempt people to put the pedal to the metal, and drinking and driving is sadly a very common habit out here as well, due to the scant chance of being caught. Even the much policed roads kill people.</p>
<h2 id=how-big-is-the-outback-of-australia-in-square-miles>How big is the outback of Australia in square miles?</h2>
<p>And that’s it! The Australian Outback is just about everywhere else 6.5 million square kilometres of it (or 2.5 million square miles), inhabited by less than 60,000 people… It’s impossible to answer the question “Where is the Australian Outback?”, because it is not a precise location.</p>
