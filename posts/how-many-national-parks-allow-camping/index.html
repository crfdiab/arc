<h2 id=how-many-national-parks-allow-camping>How many national parks allow camping?</h2>
<p>There is no shortage of camping locations in the National Park Service — there are over 130 park units to choose from! Use the map below to find a park with camping opportunities. Each location will link you directly to that park’s website.</p>
<h2 id=is-it-illegal-to-camp-in-a-national-park>Is it illegal to camp in a national park?</h2>
<p>Camping is a fun way to discover the beauty of our national parks. In NSW national parks, camping is usually restricted to within the boundaries of a campground. Follow these safety tips to keep you and your camping group safe.</p>
<h2 id=can-you-stay-overnight-at-national-parks>Can you stay overnight at national parks?</h2>
<p>So yes – you can sleep in your car at all national parks – at most parks you need to be in an actual campground or have a backcountry permit. At all parks you have to follow the rules for backcountry behavior (and that’s been mentioned above) – and at DV, a permit for so doing is necessary (and the rules apply anyway).</p>
<h2 id=is-camping-anywhere-legal>Is camping anywhere legal?</h2>
<p>Typically you are allowed to camp for free in US National Forests & Grasslands unless otherwise marked. Each national forest has slightly different rules, so check ahead of time, but generally speaking, you are allowed to camp anywhere outside established recreation areas and developed campgrounds.</p>
<h2 id=what-national-parks-are-illegal>What national parks are illegal?</h2>
<p>Climb, Walk on or Deface Structures, Rock Formations or Cultural Artifacts. It is illegal to deface, vandalize, alter, carve, climb on or walk on any natural object, monument or structure in a national park.</p>
<h2 id=can-you-sleep-in-car-at-yellowstone>Can you sleep in car at Yellowstone?</h2>
<p>Can I sleep in my car in Yellowstone? No, but paid campsites will allow you to sleep in your car if you insist. Yellowstone does not allow overnight parking in attraction parking lots, trailheads, or on the roadside.</p>
<h2 id=can-you-sleep-in-national-park-parking-lots>Can you sleep in National Park parking lots?</h2>
<p>You can sleep in your car at established campgrounds if you have a site. In the National Parks I know of, you aren’t allowed to sleep in your car anywhere else. Most people sleep outside of the Parks in a National Forest if they want to sleep in their car.</p>
<h2 id=are-there-any-national-parks-where-you-can-camp>Are there any national parks where you can camp?</h2>
<p>Camping is only permitted at designated areas in the following parks: Apart from the three parks mentioned above, camping is also allowed at Jelutong, Mamam and Ubin Living Lab Campsites at Pulau Ubin where camping approvals are required only for groups of more than 40 pax.</p>
<h2 id=how-to-get-a-camping-permit-in-a-national-park>How to get a camping permit in a National Park?</h2>
<p>A simple camping trip in our parks can be just as fun and enjoyable. To indulge in such simple pleasures of camping, simply apply for a camping permit from any AXS stations or apply online here. Camping permits will be required on both weekdays and weekends, including public and school holidays.</p>
<h2 id=are-there-any-wilderness-areas-where-you-can-camp>Are there any wilderness areas where you can camp?</h2>
<p>Wilderness areas, which can be inside other types of land-management areas, are reserved for backpacking. A few of these other federal lands might offer camping, though it’s rare. For a national database of reservable sites on all sorts of federal lands (including national parks and national forests), check out Recreation.gov.</p>
<h2 id=how-big-does-an-rv-have-to-be-to-stay-in-a-national-park>How big does an RV have to be to stay in a National Park?</h2>
<p>That said, a 25-foot trailer offers much more in the way of comfort (especially if you travel as a family), and will still fit in the vast majority of national parks campgrounds. Because RVs over 40 feet rarely fit in national parks campgrounds, those looking to stay within the parks will want to avoid going over that threshold for sure.</p>
