<h2 id=what-is-teepee-made-out-of>What is teepee made out of?</h2>
<p>Tepee, also spelled tipi, conical tent most common to the North American Plains Indians. The tepee was generally made by stretching a cover sewn of dressed buffalo skins over a framework of wooden poles; in some cases reed mats, canvas, sheets of bark, or other materials were used for the covering.</p>
<h2 id=what-were-tipis-used-for>What were tipis used for?</h2>
<p>Tipis are the conical skin- or canvas-covered dwellings used by the Plains Indians as permanent or seasonal dwellings. The Sioux word tipi literally translates as “used to live in.” In the nineteenth century each tipi accommodated, on average, eight to ten adults and children.</p>
<h2 id=who-invented-tipis>Who invented tipis?</h2>
<p>Hollywood has taught us much during the 100+ years of making Westerns. Everyone now knows that the Lakota (Sioux) invented the teepee and that all teepee’s are made of buffalo hides. By the time that the White Man arrived, the Sioux invention had spread throughout the continent.</p>
<h2 id=why-did-native-americans-use-tipis>Why did Native Americans use tipis?</h2>
<p>The tribes kept moving following the migration of the bison. The Plains Indians lived in tipis because they are easily disassembled and so allow a lifestyle of following game. The tipi was durable, provided warmth and comfort in winter, was dry during heavy rains, and was cool in the heat of summer.</p>
<h2 id=why-is-it-called-a-tee-pee>Why is it called a Tee Pee?</h2>
<p>The word tipi comes into English from the Lakota language. The Lakota word thípi [ˈtʰipi] means “a dwelling” or “they dwell”, from the verb thí, meaning “to dwell”. The term wigwam has often been incorrectly used to refer to a conical skin tipi.</p>
<h2 id=what-kind-of-home-was-the-tipi-made-of>What kind of home was the tipi made of?</h2>
<p>A tepee (tipi, teepee) is a Plains Indian home. It is made of buffalo hide fastened around very long wooden poles, designed in a cone shape.</p>
<h2 id=what-kind-of-material-was-a-teepee-made-of>What kind of material was a teepee made of?</h2>
<p>Teepee is a tall, cone-shaped tent dwelling used by the plains’ Indians, and was made by stretching buffalo skin over a skeleton of 20-30 wooden poles, all slanted towards a central point and tied together near the top.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-the-plains-indians-decorate-their-teepees>How did the Plains Indians decorate their teepees?</h2>
<p>The plains Native Americans often decorated their teepees with pictures of animals and gods and tribal symbols. Each tribe had its own symbol, which was used on their teepees, bodies and weapons. Paint was made from plants and clays.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-etiquette-of-a-tipi-tepee>What was the etiquette of a tipi tepee?</h2>
<p>Tepee Etiquette: If the entrance flap was open, it was an invitation to enter. If the flap was closed, you needed to announce yourself and wait for an invitation to enter a tepee, even if you lived there. A guest always sat to the left of the head of the family, who always sat the farthest from the door flap.</p>
