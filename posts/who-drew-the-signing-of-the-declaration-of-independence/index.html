<h2 id=who-drew-the-signing-of-the-declaration-of-independence>Who drew the signing of the Declaration of Independence?</h2>
<p>In the central group in the painting, Thomas Jefferson, the principal author of the Declaration, is shown placing the document before John Hancock, president of the Congress. With him stand the other members of the committee that created the draft: John Adams, Roger Sherman, Robert Livingston and Benjamin Franklin.</p>
<h2 id=who-was-the-most-famous-american-during-the-signing-of-the-declaration-of-independence>Who was the most famous American during the signing of the Declaration of Independence?</h2>
<p>John Hancock<br>
The most famous signature on the engrossed copy is that of John Hancock, who presumably signed first as President of Congress.</p>
<h2 id=who-was-the-first-person-to-photograph-an-american-indian>Who was the first person to photograph an American Indian?</h2>
<p>Thomas Easterly is credited as the first to photograph American Indians in the United States, in March 1847, when he took daguerreotypes of Chief Keokuk and other Sauk and Fox Indians who had traveled from present-day Kansas to St. Louis, Missouri.</p>
<h2 id=when-did-the-painting-of-washington-as-statesman-come-out>When did the painting of Washington as statesman come out?</h2>
<p>Stearns’s “Statesman” painting was actually reproduced on a three-cent commemorative postage stamp in September 1937, first issued in Philadelphia on the 17th of September, to honor the 150th anniversary of the Signing of the Constitution!</p>
<h2 id=who-was-the-artist-of-the-jefferson-memorial-mural>Who was the artist of the Jefferson memorial mural?</h2>
<p>Pope designed both the National Archives and the Jefferson Memorial. The mural depicts Madison delivering the final draft of the Constitution to Washington. By contrast, Christy’s painting makes a great effort at historical authenticity, engages in political interpretation, captures the Convention at work, and brings the American Founders to life.</p>
<h2 id=where-are-the-photographs-from-the-signing-of-the-declaration-of-independence>Where are the photographs from the signing of the declaration of Independence?</h2>
<p>The bicentennial of the signing of the Declaration of Independence in 1976 changed all that. The photographs on the wall have been removed and placed in the Second Bank in Philadelphia or the National Portrait Gallery in Washington D. C. Independence Hall has been restored to its original shape and design.</p>
