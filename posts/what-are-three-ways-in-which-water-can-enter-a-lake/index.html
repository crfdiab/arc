<h2 id=what-are-three-ways-in-which-water-can-enter-a-lake>What are three ways in which water can enter a lake?</h2>
<p>The water in lakes comes from rain, snow, melting ice, streams, and groundwater seepage.</p>
<h2 id=where-does-the-water-in-lakes-go>Where does the water in lakes go?</h2>
<p>Creeks flow into streams, which flow through lakes, which ultimately end up in major rivers that drain into the ocean. You can picture it like branches of a tree going down into the trunk. These watershed areas are defined by topography, or ridges of elevation.</p>
<h2 id=how-does-water-stay-in-a-lake>How does water stay in a lake?</h2>
<p>For a lake to keep its water over time, it has to be replenished. The main way that water gets into reservoirs and man-made lakes is from the rivers and streams that were dammed to create them. Like man-made reservoirs and lakes, natural lakes may also be replenished by rivers and streams.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-source-of-water-in-a-lake>What is the source of water in a lake?</h2>
<p>Lakes are supplied with water by rainfall that falls directly on the surface of the lake, by water run-off from the adjacent land and small streams, or by groundwater that seeps through the soil to the lowest point which is the lake.</p>
<h2 id=how-do-they-fill-up-man-made-lakes>How do they fill up man made lakes?</h2>
<p>Man made lakes are usually constructed by building a dam across A deep river valley which then backs up with water flooding several square miles of land . This is to allow the storage of drinking water and quite often as a source of hydro electric power by runnnig the water through turbines .</p>
<h2 id=do-lakes-dry-up>Do lakes dry up?</h2>
<p>A number of lakes throughout the world are drying or completely dry due to irrigation or urban use diverting inflow.</p>
<h2 id=does-water-flow-out-of-a-lake>Does water flow out of a lake?</h2>
<p>How does water get out of a lake? It may evaporate from the surface of the lake. That’s when the Sun’s energy turns some water into a gas called water vapor. Or, water may leave a lake in a river that drains extra water away.</p>
<h2 id=where-does-the-water-come-from-to-form-a-lake>Where does the water come from to form a lake?</h2>
<p>A lake is where surface-water runoff (and maybe some groundwater seepage) have accumulated in a low spot, relative to the surrounding countryside. It’s not that the water that forms lakes get trapped, but that the water entering a lake comes in faster than it can escape, either via outflow in a river, seepage into the ground, or by evaporation.</p>
<h2 id=what-happens-when-water-evaporates-from-a-lake>What happens when water evaporates from a lake?</h2>
<p>It may evaporate from the surface of the lake. That’s when the Sun’s energy turns some water into a gas called water vapor. Or, water may leave a lake in a river that drains extra water away.</p>
<h2 id=when-does-a-river-turn-into-a-lake>When does a river turn into a lake?</h2>
<p>A river has its natural and defined banks (well, most rivers do at least so lets focus on them first). A lake, at some point, at the head of the lake (where the river feeds it) the river obviously floods over its God-given natural banks. Would this have happened if there were no lake (dam) downstream?</p>
<h2 id=how-are-lakes-and-reservoirs-affected-by-humans>How are lakes and reservoirs affected by humans?</h2>
<p>It’s not that the water that forms lakes get trapped, but that the water entering a lake comes in faster than it can escape, either via outflow in a river, seepage into the ground, or by evaporation. And if humans live nearby, then water levels can be affected by water withdrawals for human needs.</p>
