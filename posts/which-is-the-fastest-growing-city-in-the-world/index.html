<h2 id=which-is-the-fastest-growing-city-in-the-world>Which is the fastest growing city in the world?</h2>
<p>However, if we consider the absolute number of people added to city populations each year, many of the largest cities figure prominently as the most rapidly growing cities.</p>
<h2 id=are-there-small-cities-with-rapid-population-growth>Are there small cities with rapid population growth?</h2>
<p>When reviewing inter-census changes in population for all urban centres in a country, there are often small cities with very rapid population growth rates for one or two census periods – much more rapid than the cities in table 1.</p>
<h2 id=which-is-the-fastest-growing-city-in-nigeria>Which is the fastest growing city in Nigeria?</h2>
<p>The majority of the nation’s commerce occurs in the city’s central business district. Further, the Port of Lagos is the oil exporter’s largest trading hub and one of the largest ports on the continent. Lagos has grown. It will continue to grow.</p>
<h2 id=why-is-mogadishu-the-fastest-growing-city-in-the-world>Why is Mogadishu the fastest growing city in the world?</h2>
<p>Mogadishu’s growth is driven by its improving security situation and economic prospects after decades of civil war – many Somalis have returned from abroad. Mogadishu in Somalia has population growth of 6.9% according to Demographia. Photograph: Roberto Schmidt/AFP/Getty Images</p>

<p>Generally speaking, the population growth in Bombay and Jakarta was faster than that of other cities and Tokyo had the highest residents in 2010. Moreover, a higher number of people started living in urban areas than in rural areas after 2005.</p>
<h2 id=how-is-population-growth-related-to-economic-development>How is population growth related to economic development?</h2>
<p>Population growth is usually related to economic development. There occurs a typical fall in death rates and birth rates due to improved living conditions leading to low population growth, a phenomenon called demographic transition. It is associated with urbanisation and growth and occurs in four phases:</p>

<p>There occurs a typical fall in death rates and birth rates due to improved living conditions leading to low population growth, a phenomenon called demographic transition. It is associated with urbanisation and growth and occurs in four phases: (a) Pre-industrial phase characterized by high growth and death rates and net population growth is low.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-population-of-cities-in-1980>What was the population of cities in 1980?</h2>
<p>Finally, the global urban population in 1980 was below 2 billion while 3 billion lived in villages. The population in cities grew steadily and went over 4 billion in 2010 at which point 3 billion global population resided in rural areas. Population growth in Bombay and Jakarta, almost 5.5 times, was higher than any other city listed.</p>
