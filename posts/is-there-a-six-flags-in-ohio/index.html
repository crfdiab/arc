<p>Funtime was acquired by Premier Parks in 1995, and for the 2000 season, they re-branded Geauga Lake as Six Flags Ohio, adding four new roller coasters. The following year, Six Flags bought the adjacent SeaWorld Ohio and combined the two parks under the name Six Flags Worlds of Adventure.</p>
<h2 id=what-whales-were-at-seaworld-ohio>What whales were at SeaWorld Ohio?</h2>
<p>In those early days, Sea World of Ohio (later known as Sea World Ohio and then Sea World Adventure Park Cleveland), boasted a single killer whale, Shamu, among its cast of dolphins, seals and penguins. It was only open 100 days out of the year.</p>
<h2 id=what-happened-to-shamu-from-seaworld-ohio>What happened to Shamu from SeaWorld Ohio?</h2>
<p>After six years in captivity, Shamu died. Before her death, she seriously injured several people, including Anne Eckis, a SeaWorld employee, who she bit during a live recorded performance. Shamu had reportedly shown signs of erratic behavior before the incident. After her death, Shamu’s name lived on.</p>
<h2 id=where-is-the-seaworld-park-in-ohio-located>Where is the SeaWorld park in Ohio located?</h2>
<p>SeaWorld Ohio was a theme park and marine zoological park, located in Aurora, Ohio. It was owned and operated by SeaWorld Parks & Entertainment, formerly known as Busch Entertainment Corporation. The Ohio location was the second SeaWorld park to be built in the chain, following SeaWorld San Diego which opened just six years earlier.</p>
<h2 id=when-did-sea-world-in-cleveland-ohio-close>When did Sea World in Cleveland Ohio close?</h2>
<p>After a long battle to keep the marine animal theme park open, financial troubles forced the facility to close for good in the early 2000s. The owners of the Sea World chain of theme parks took a big risk when it decided to open a location in Ohio in 1970.</p>
<h2 id=is-the-seaworld-in-aurora-ohio-still-open>Is the SeaWorld in Aurora Ohio still open?</h2>
<p>AURORA, Ohio — SeaWorld Ohio was a staple attraction of Northeast Ohio for three decades. But today, long after it closed forever, remaining portions of the former marine life theme park now rest in decay.</p>
<h2 id=when-did-seaworld-geauga-lake-in-ohio-close>When did SeaWorld Geauga Lake in Ohio close?</h2>
<p>Awesome park!” SeaWorld Ohio closed in 2001 before the space became the property of Six Flags Ohio. When Cedar Fair purchased the land a few years later, a sliver of the former SeaWorld space was transformed into the Wildwater Kingdom water park. Fast forward to 2007, Geauga Lake closed forever leaving behind only the water park.</p>
