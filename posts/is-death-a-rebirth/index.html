<h2 id=when-do-we-die-are-we-reborn-as-a-new-person>When do we die are we reborn as a new person?</h2>
<p>According to that definition, we all are reborn as a new person after a breath we exhale. This is a constant cycles of rebirth and death. After the moment of our last breath, we continue the journey of life in different physical forms.</p>
<h2 id=do-you-have-to-let-go-of-the-past-to-be-reborn>Do you have to let go of the past to be reborn?</h2>
<p>In every moment, we have the chance to taste the fragility of life in death, and choose to re-invent ourselves through becoming re-born again and again and again.

<h2 id=what-happens-when-you-die-and-become-someone-else>What happens when you die and become someone else?</h2>
<p>When you die you are reborn as someone else on Earth, but the past memories are blocked but you do start to gain them back if you stay in the place you are in, but Bob wants to send you back to experience more because you are not finished just yet.</p>

<p>It can signify a time of starting fresh, of being conjured anew, of creating a blank page for the future. Flowers are born anew each spring, butterflies born from their cocoons. The scent of re-birth can imply blue skies and endless vast horizons. Everything is suddenly awoken, stirring with possibility.</p>
