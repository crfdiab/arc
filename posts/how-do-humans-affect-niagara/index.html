<h2 id=how-do-humans-affect-niagara>How do humans affect Niagara?</h2>
<p>The by-product of this conflict was pollution. With the settlement of families in Niagara and around the Upper Great Lakes came the need and desire to farm, fish and hunt in order to survive. The resulting development led to garbage, sewage and human waste being dumped into the water.</p>
<h2 id=how-many-bodies-were-found-at-the-bottom-of-niagara-falls>How many bodies were found at the bottom of Niagara Falls?</h2>
<p>An estimated 5,000 bodies were found at the foot of the falls between 1850 and 2011. On average, between 20 and 30 people die going over the falls each year. The majority of deaths are suicides, and most take place from the Canadian Horseshoe Falls. Many of these suicides are not publicized by officials.</p>
<h2 id=why-is-niagara-falls-so-deadly>Why is Niagara Falls so deadly?</h2>
<p>The forces that can knock you around inside the barrel are massively strong, so the chance of concussion-type injuries from rapid deceleration and acceleration is extremely high. There is also the danger from hitting the rocks and having the barrel break apart.</p>
<h2 id=why-are-niagara-falls-in-so-much-trouble>Why are Niagara Falls in so much trouble?</h2>
<p>Scientists became aware that Niagara Falls might in fact be in some very deep trouble. Over the thousands of years that the falls had been flowing, a ton of stones and rocks had accumulated at the bottom falls. Now, the flow alteration that they were making was becoming quite noticeable.</p>
<h2 id=how-often-do-people-die-over-niagara-falls>How often do people die over Niagara Falls?</h2>
<p>On average, between 20 and 30 people die going over the falls each year. The majority of deaths are suicides—and most take place from the Canadian Horseshoe Falls, and many are not publicized by officials. Mortality rate for the daredevil attempts over the falls is approximately 25%.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-the-discovery-of-the-bones-change-niagara-falls>How did the discovery of the bones change Niagara Falls?</h2>
<p>The 1969 discovery of the bones suddenly changed the way people viewed Niagara Falls. While it was once solely seen as a place of beauty, it was now very intimidating for some and seen as dangerous. It made the masses feel like their lives were truly fragile.</p>
<h2 id=is-it-illegal-to-go-over-niagara-falls>Is it illegal to go over Niagara Falls?</h2>
<p>All instances of people having survived the trip over the falls have been over the Canadian Horseshoe Falls. Following the death of one daredevil in 1951, stunting at Niagara Falls has been illegal and subject to fines of up to $25,000 USD . A number of people have gained notability by their stunts, both successful and fatal.</p>
