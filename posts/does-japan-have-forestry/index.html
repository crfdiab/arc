<h2 id=does-japan-have-forestry>Does Japan have forestry?</h2>
<p>Japan’s forests cover 66% of the land, making it one of the most heavily forested countries in the world. The Japanese forest industry has been defeated by cheap wood shipped from abroad. The cheap price, however, does not include environmental costs.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-forestry-policy-in-japan>What is the forestry policy in Japan?</h2>
<p>-GOJ stipulates “transforming forestry into a leading industry” through creation of wood demand and stable supply of domestic wood in national economic policies.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-value-of-forestry>What is the value of forestry?</h2>
<p>The estimated total value of the world’s forests is as much as $150 trillion—nearly double the value of global stock markets. The ability of forests to regulate the climate through carbon storage is by far the largest component of that total value, accounting for as much as 90%.</p>
<h2 id=do-they-cut-trees-in-japan>Do they cut trees in Japan?</h2>
<p>Japan continued to cut down large forested areas in order to rebuild. Old growth and secondary stands were increasingly fragmented as areas were clear-cut to allow for reconstruction.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-importance-of-wood-in-japanese-culture>What is the importance of wood in Japanese culture?</h2>
<p>Since ancient times, wood has been contemplated with reverence in Japan. Even after being cut, it’s been seen as a living being. Shinto, the country’s original religion, viewed trees as divine, a means by which the gods descended to earth.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-japan-respond-to-deforestation>How did Japan respond to deforestation?</h2>
<p>The shogun responded to deforestation by implementing a national plan to reduce logging and replace destroyed forests. Under the new policy, one had to obtain special permission from the government for the harvest and use of wood. The shogun also encouraged the planting of trees.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-value-of-forests-in-japan>What was the value of forests in Japan?</h2>
<p>The value of Japan’s forestry production has been steadily declining since it peaked at around ¥1.158 trillion in 1980. By 2014, it had dropped to less than ¥450 billion.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-the-laws-about-forestry-in-japan>What are the laws about forestry in Japan?</h2>
<p>Law Currently, the Forest Act and the Forest and Forestry Basic Act are the main Acts concerning forests and forestry in Japan. The overview and the history of each Act are covered hereunder. Forest Act The current Forest Act is the Third Forest Act enacted in 1951]</p>
<h2 id=what-kind-of-forests-are-there-in-japan>What kind of forests are there in Japan?</h2>
<p>In particular, plantation forests increased threefold to 19 million cubic meters, while natural forests increased by about 20 percent to 16 million cubic meters. Japan’s plantation forests are mostly covered with coniferous trees. In particular, cedar trees planted after the Second World War account for over half the plantation forests’ volume.</p>
<h2 id=how-many-people-work-in-the-forest-industry-in-japan>How many people work in the forest industry in Japan?</h2>
<p>Due to the declining forestry industry in Japan, the number of forestry workers dropped from about 440,000 in the early 1960s to the current 67,000. More than 30 percent of these workers are over 65 years old, a symptom of the rapid aging of the working population.</p>
