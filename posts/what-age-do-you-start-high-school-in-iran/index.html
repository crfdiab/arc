<h2 id=what-age-do-you-start-high-school-in-iran>What age do you start high school in Iran?</h2>
<p>Education System Overview: After each cycle, students will receive a certificate of completion if they pass the final exam of that cycle. All children spend six years of their lives at primary level from ages 6 to 12 and attend high school from ages 12 to 18.</p>
<h2 id=how-many-years-is-secondary-school-in-iran>How many years is secondary school in Iran?</h2>
<p>It consists of one year of preprimary education at age 5, five years of primary education (from age 6 to 11), three years of lower secondary, or guidance, school (from age 11 to 14), and three years of secondary school (from age 14 to 17).</p>
<h2 id=is-iran-education-hard>Is Iran education hard?</h2>
<p>The education system in Iran is divided into two main levels: primary education and high-school education. Getting into one of these well-known Nemuneh Mardomi schools is tough. All schools have an entrance exam to identify the best students, and the competition for places can be intense.</p>
<h2 id=how-long-does-it-take-to-go-to-school-in-iran>How long does it take to go to school in Iran?</h2>
<p>The process begins with 1 year of pre-school orientation following which children automatically enter primary school. There they pass through grades 1 to 5. At the end of this, they sit a national examination that they must pass too, if they are to enter middle school. Four years of secondary education cover grades 9 to 12.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-name-of-the-primary-school-in-iran>What is the name of the primary school in Iran?</h2>
<p>Primary school is called “Dabestan” and includes grades 1 to 5 (ages 6 to 11). At the end of the 5th year, students take a nation-wide exam which they must pass in order to continue to the next cycle.</p>
<h2 id=how-does-the-education-system-work-in-iran>How does the education system work in Iran?</h2>
<p>There are no boys around. In Iran, all schools are single-sex. The education system in Iran is divided into two main levels: primary education and high-school education. All children spend six years of their lives at primary level from ages six to 12 and attend high school from ages 12 to 18.</p>
<h2 id=when-does-rojan-go-to-school-in-iran>When does Rojan go to school in Iran?</h2>
<p>Rojan, like other Iranian school girls, gets up early for school. Classes start at 7.30 a.m. and finish around 1 p.m. When she arrives, she joins lots of other girls playing in the school yard. Some are bright and full of energy, others are sleepy.</p>
