<h2 id=what-do-people-get-wrong-about-christopher-columbus>What do people get wrong about Christopher Columbus?</h2>
<p>Public monuments in his honor are threatened or removed. Every year, more states and cities change Columbus Day to “Indigenous Peoples’ Day” or “Native Americans’ Day.” And left-wing professors smear the once-revered hero who discovered America in 1492.</p>
<h2 id=where-did-christopher-columbus-think-he-saw-mermaids>Where did Christopher Columbus think he saw mermaids?</h2>
<p>Explorer Christopher Columbus, sailing near the Dominican Republic, believes he spots three “mermaids.” In reality they were manatees.</p>
<h2 id=why-did-people-want-to-discredit-christopher-columbus>Why did people want to discredit Christopher Columbus?</h2>
<p>They claimed that because people in Columbus’s time were religious, they were therefore crude and ignorant. These enemies wanted to discredit the Church by portraying it as the enemy of science. But Christopher Columbus, a deeply religious man, would be the first to disagree.</p>
<h2 id=what-did-christopher-columbus-do-to-the-arawaks>What did Christopher Columbus do to the Arawaks?</h2>
<p>By 1531, 600 and by 1650, there were no longer any full-blooded Arawaks left on the islands. The way Columbus and his men treated the women and children of these populations was even worse. Columbus routinely used the raping of women as a “reward” for his lieutenants.</p>

<h2 id=what-kind-of-map-did-christopher-columbus-use>What kind of map did Christopher Columbus use?</h2>
<p>Columbus rejected Ptolemy ’s estimate of the journey from West to East overland, substituting a far longer one based on a chart (now lost) supplied by the Florentine mathematician and geographer Paolo Toscanelli, and on Columbus’s preference for the calculations of the Classical geographer Marinus of Tyre.</p>
<h2 id=where-did-christopher-columbus-make-his-last-stop-on-his-voyage>Where did Christopher Columbus make his last stop on his voyage?</h2>
<p>On 13 January 1493, Columbus made his last stop of this voyage in the New World, in the Bay of Rincón at the eastern end of the Samaná Peninsula in northeast Hispaniola. There he encountered the warlike Cigüayos, the only natives who offered violent resistance during his first voyage to the Americas.</p>
<h2 id=when-did-christopher-columbus-underestimate-the-earth>When did Christopher Columbus underestimate the Earth?</h2>
<p>Based on the known world, Columbus underestimated it by one fourth. In the late nineteenth century, enemies of Christianity spread the lie that medieval men believed in a flat earth.</p>
