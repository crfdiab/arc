<h2 id=what-was-the-main-food-in-mesopotamia>What was the main food in Mesopotamia?</h2>
<p>The main food would be bread, fruits, pulses, and vegetables. Fruits would have included dates, figs, melons, and possibly fruits imported from other countries. Meat could be in abundance at banquets. Whole oxen were roasted; ducks, chickens, geese, and pigeons were served.</p>
<h2 id=what-kinds-of-foods-from-mesopotamia-do-we-still-eat-today>What kinds of foods from Mesopotamia do we still eat today?</h2>
<p>Dairy products like milk, cheese, yogurt, and butter. Soups made from beans, lentils, and chickpeas. Fruits, like apricots, apples, and pears. Vegetables, such as cucumbers, radishes, and beets.</p>
<h2 id=what-country-would-mesopotamia-reside-in-today>What country would Mesopotamia reside in today?</h2>
<p>Mesopotamia is an ancient, historical region that lies between the Tigris and Euphrates rivers in modern-day Iraq and parts of Kuwait, Syria, Turkey and Iran.</p>
<h2 id=what-kind-of-food-did-people-in-ancient-mesopotamia-eat>What kind of food did people in ancient Mesopotamia eat?</h2>
<p>If the Atkin’s diet is mainly based on meat, then we can equally say that the ancient Mesopotamian diet was largely based on barley, a type of cereal grain. That’s not to say that that’s all the people of ancient Mesopotamia ate, not at all. But barley-based food was the cornerstone of their diet.</p>
<h2 id=what-kind-of-beer-did-ancient-mesopotamians-drink>What kind of beer did ancient Mesopotamians drink?</h2>
<p>To season his bread, soup, or meat, Shulgi also had a lot of herbs and spices to choose from, including salt, black cumin, mustard, mint, thyme, rosemary, and coriander. But Shulgi had to drink something as well! Ancient Mesopotamians consumed barley-beer, which is beer without hops.</p>
<h2 id=what-kind-of-clothing-did-people-in-mesopotamia-wear>What kind of clothing did people in Mesopotamia wear?</h2>
<p>Princesses and other important people wear very colorful clothes and wears many jewelry. Gold and silver usually. The clothing in Mesopotamia is very different from others, ignoring the fact of wearing jewelry.</p>
<h2 id=why-was-farming-so-important-in-ancient-mesopotamia>Why was farming so important in ancient Mesopotamia?</h2>
<p>Even though the farmland of Sumer was so fertile, crops planted there still needed water, and rainfall in the area, even during ancient times, would have been very scarce. As a result, Mesopotamians developed a system of irrigation.</p>
