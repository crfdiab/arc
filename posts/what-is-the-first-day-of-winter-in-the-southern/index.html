<h2 id=what-is-the-first-day-of-winter-in-the-southern>What is the first day of winter in the Southern?</h2>
<p>For the northern half of Earth (the Northern Hemisphere), the winter solstice occurs annually on December 21 or 22. (For the Southern Hemisphere, the winter solstice occurs on June 20 or 21.) The winter solstice is the day with the fewest hours of sunlight in the whole year, making it the “shortest day” of the year.</p>
<h2 id=what-month-does-winter-begin-in-south-america>What month does winter begin in South America?</h2>
<p>Remember that the southern hemisphere seasons are reversed – with summer roughly November to February, and winter in June to August.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-the-winter-months-in-the-south>What are the winter months in the south?</h2>
<p>What is different is when those seasons occur on the Jovian Calendar. Our northern winter is in Dec, Jan and Feb, whereas the southern winter is in June, July, and August.</p>
<h2 id=what-makes-the-first-day-of-winter>What makes the first day of winter?</h2>
<p>In the United States and the rest of the northern hemisphere, the first day of the winter season is the day of the year when the Sun is farthest south (on December 21st or 22nd). This day is known as the Winter Solstice.</p>
<h2 id=what-determines-first-day-winter>What determines first day winter?</h2>
<p>Most people consider the first day of winter to be the Winter Solstice, which this year occurs December 21 at 5:02 am. EST. Winter begins then because, astronomically-speaking, the sun will be directly overhead of the Tropic of Capricorn – the southern-most point the sun will be directly overhead during the year.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-hottest-state-in-the-winter>What is the hottest state in the winter?</h2>
<p>Florida ranks overall as the warmest state year round. The other state in the top four is Hawaii. The group of tropical islands ranks second to Florida as the country’s hottest state. Hawaii rises to the top of the list in winter, with average monthly temperatures well above those of any other state.</p>
<h2 id=which-is-the-first-day-of-winter-in-north-america>Which is the first day of winter in North America?</h2>
<p>The December Solstice. (North America, Central America, Europe, Asia, northern Africa) (Australia, New Zealand, South America, Southern Africa) First Day or Mid Winter? In the USA and some other areas in the Northern Hemisphere, the winter solstice marks the first day of winter.</p>
<h2 id=when-is-the-first-day-of-winter-in-australia>When is the first day of winter in Australia?</h2>
<p>(Australia, New Zealand, South America, Southern Africa) First Day or Mid Winter? In the USA and some other areas in the Northern Hemisphere, the winter solstice marks the first day of winter.</p>
<h2 id=is-the-winter-solstice-the-first-day-of-winter>Is the winter solstice the first day of winter?</h2>
<p>The Winter Solstice is the MIDDLE day of winter – it is in the middle of the 90 shortest days of the year. Just like June 21 is the middle of summer, not the first day of summer – probably why in almost every northern hemisphere country other than the US, June 21 is called ‘midsummer’.</p>
<h2 id=when-does-winter-start-in-the-southern-hemisphere>When does winter start in the southern hemisphere?</h2>
<p>winter runs from December 1 to February 28 (February 29 in a leap year ). When the Northern Hemisphere gets most sunlight (summer), the Southern Hemisphere gets least (winter). Seasons in the Southern Hemisphere are opposite to those in the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
