<h2 id=why-does-the-eiffel-tower-shrink>Why does the Eiffel Tower shrink?</h2>
<p>For 41 years after it opened in 1889, the Eiffel Tower remained the tallest building in the world. 4) Because heat causes the metal Tower to expand and cold causes it to shrink, the height of the Tower can vary with the outside temperature by 15 centimeters (5.9 inches).</p>
<h2 id=what-happens-to-the-eiffel-tower-in-the-summer>What happens to the Eiffel Tower in the summer?</h2>
<p>The Eiffel Tower gets taller by up to 6 inches during the summer, when the temperature reaches as high as 40°C. Extreme heat causes the metal at the base to expand, increasing the height of the 300-metre-tall tower. It also causes the top of the tower to tilt away from the sun by up to 7 inches.</p>
<h2 id=does-the-eiffel-tower-expand>Does the Eiffel Tower expand?</h2>
<p>During the World’s Fair in 1889, Contractor Gustave Eiffel introduced the Eiffel Tower. Like most materials, the tower undergoes thermal expansion. Thermal expansion is when a material changes dimensions while it undergoes temperature changes. The tower expands and contracts 15 cm from the hottest to the coldest day.”</p>
<h2 id=did-you-know-eiffel-tower-gets-taller-in-summer>Did you know Eiffel tower gets taller in summer?</h2>
<p>A few centimeters gained in summer, but lost in winter! This is a natural physical phenomenon called thermal expansion. Heat causes an increase in volume that makes the Eiffel Tower a few centimeters taller. This expansion also causes the Tower to tilt slightly away from the sun.</p>
<h2 id=is-eiffel-tower-increases-every-year>Is Eiffel tower increases every year?</h2>
<p>Everything you ever wanted to know about how and why the Eiffel Tower changes size. Over its 131-year history, the Eiffel Tower has gotten taller thanks to radio and television antennas. But in addition to this new equipment added at the top, its metal structure gains or loses a few centimeters throughout the year.</p>
<h2 id=when-did-the-eiffel-tower-grow-and-shrink>When did the Eiffel Tower grow and shrink?</h2>
<p>The Eiffel Tower grows and shrinks The Eiffel Tower was finished in 1889, and yet every single summer it still manages to grow. When temperatures reach in excess of 40 degrees Celsius (104 degrees Fahrenheit), the metal at the base of the tower expands, raising the tower up to 6 inches higher.</p>
<h2 id=how-often-is-the-eiffel-tower-repainted>How often is the Eiffel tower repainted?</h2>
<p>In case you were wondering, it requires 60 tonnes of paint to coat the entire tower, and is repainted every seven years. 4. It grows! The Eiffel gains 7 inches under the sun but shrinks back in the cold. 5. Temporary Structure Turned Permanent</p>
<h2 id=why-was-the-curvature-of-the-eiffel-tower-chosen>Why was the curvature of the Eiffel Tower chosen?</h2>
<p>The curvature of the uprights is mathematically determined to offer the most efficient wind resistance possible. As Eiffel himself explains: “All the cutting force of the wind passes into the interior of the leading edge uprights.</p>
<h2 id=when-was-the-first-digging-done-for-the-eiffel-tower>When was the first digging done for the Eiffel Tower?</h2>
<p>Today, it’s a popular icon in French history and culture, but it wasn’t always so popular. Here are some Paris Eiffel Tower facts from its early stages, when the tower first started welcoming visitors! The first digging work for the Eiffel Tower started on January 28, 1887, the tower was completed on March 31, 1889!</p>
