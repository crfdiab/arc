<h2 id=how-would-you-describe-a-small-wave>How would you describe a small wave?</h2>
<p>Here are some adjectives for ocean waves: smaller ordinary, beautiful balmy, savage green, slow, undulating, hot black, briny, sluggish, undulating, stylized, fickle, petrified, stormy, balmy, merciless, restless, far-off, calm, lofty, frantic, peaceful, gentle, uneasy, deeper, countless, western, wild, rough, dark.</p>
<h2 id=how-do-you-describe-a-wave>How do you describe a wave?</h2>
<p>Waves involve the transport of energy without the transport of matter. In conclusion, a wave can be described as a disturbance that travels through a medium, transporting energy from one location (its source) to another location without transporting matter.</p>
<h2 id=what-kind-of-waves-travel-in-the-ocean>What kind of waves travel in the ocean?</h2>
<p>This creates stress on the water and results in tiny short wavelength waves called ripples. Ripples are often called capillary waves. Breaking Waves – <a href=http://mrvanarsdale.com/marine-science/online-textbook/chapter-6-waves/>http://mrvanarsdale.com/marine-science/online-textbook/chapter-6-waves/</a> Waves travel with little change across the vast expanses of the open ocean, but eventually all waves must reach shore.</p>
<h2 id=whats-the-name-of-the-wave-that-breaks-along-its-length>What’s the name of the wave that breaks along its length?</h2>
<p>These are the first small waves created when the wind blows on the sea. (i.e. baby swell) Moderate local winds form little waves known as chop which can kill a good surf session. It’s also know as “wind chop.” This is a wave that breaks along its entire length at the same time making it unsurfable.</p>
<h2 id=what-kind-of-waves-are-called-rogue-waves>What kind of waves are called rogue waves?</h2>
<p>Rogues, called ‘extreme storm waves’ by scientists, are those waves which are greater than twice the size of surrounding waves, are very unpredictable, and often come unexpectedly from directions other than prevailing wind and waves. Most reports of extreme storm waves say they look like “walls…</p>
<h2 id=what-kind-of-wave-is-a-capillary-wave>What kind of wave is a capillary wave?</h2>
<p>Ripples: The ruffling of the water’s surface due to pressure variations of the wind on the water. This creates stress on the water and results in tiny short wavelength waves called ripples. Ripples are often called capillary waves.</p>
