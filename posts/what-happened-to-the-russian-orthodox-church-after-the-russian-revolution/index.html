<h2 id=what-happened-to-the-russian-orthodox-church-after-the-russian-revolution>What happened to the Russian Orthodox Church after the Russian revolution?</h2>
<p>Russian revolution After a few months of political turmoil, the Bolsheviks took power in October 1917 and declared a separation of church and state. The government seized all church lands. Thus the Russian Orthodox Church found itself without official state backing for the first time in its history.</p>
<h2 id=what-happened-to-religious-life-in-russia-after-the-fall-of-the-soviet-union>What happened to religious life in Russia after the fall of the Soviet Union?</h2>
<p>When the Soviet Union was dissolved on Dec. During nearly 70 years of Soviet rule, religious practice had been gradually forced out of public and private life. Faith leaders were sent to labor camps and sacred buildings fell into disrepair.</p>
<h2 id=what-happened-to-the-russian-orthodox-church-under-peter>What happened to the Russian Orthodox Church under Peter?</h2>
<p>A congregation of Orthodox church leaders in Russia. It was established by Peter the Great, Stefan Yavorsky, and Feofan Prokopovich in January 1721 to replace the Patriarchate of Moscow. It was abolished following the February Revolution of 1917 and replaced with a restored patriarchate under Tikhon of Moscow.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-the-fall-of-the-soviet-union-affect-religion-in-russia>How did the fall of the Soviet Union affect religion in Russia?</h2>
<p>Following the breakup of the Soviet Union, many Russians returned to religious practices. Christianity, Islam, Judaism, and Buddhism were allowed full liberty as traditional religions of Russia. Roman Catholics and Protestants can be found in Russia in addition to Eastern Orthodox Christians.</p>
<h2 id=which-is-the-fastest-growing-religion-in-russia>Which is the fastest growing religion in Russia?</h2>
<p>Hinduism has been spread in Russia primarily due to the work of scholars from the religious organization International Society for Krishna Consciousness (ISKCON) and by itinerant Swamis from India and small communities of Indian immigrants.</p>
<h2 id=who-is-the-god-of-orthodox>Who is the God of Orthodox?</h2>
<p>Eastern Orthodox Christians believe in a single God who is both three and one (triune); the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, “one in essence and undivided”. The Holy Trinity is three “unconfused” and distinct divine persons (hypostases), who share one divine essence (ousia); uncreated, immaterial and eternal.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-the-russian-orthodox-church-get-weakened>How did the Russian Orthodox Church get weakened?</h2>
<p>The Russian Orthodox Church was further weakened in 1922, when the Renovated Church, a reform movement supported by the Soviet government, seceded from Patriarch Tikhon’s church, restored a Holy Synod to power, and brought division among clergy and faithful.</p>
<h2 id=when-did-the-russian-orthodox-church-become-an-autonomous-church>When did the Russian Orthodox Church become an autonomous church?</h2>
<p>In 1970 it finally recognized an autocephalous Orthodox Church in America, thereby renouncing its former canonical claims in the United States and Canada; it also acknowledged an autonomous church established in Japan that same year. Following the collapse of the Soviet Union, discussions concerning the reunification of the churches were initiated.</p>
<h2 id=why-did-the-russian-orthodox-church-support-the-bolsheviks>Why did the Russian Orthodox Church support the Bolsheviks?</h2>
<p>The Russian Orthodox Church supported the White Army in the Russian Civil War (see White movement) after the October Revolution. This may have further strengthened the Bolshevik animus against the church. According to Lenin, a communist regime cannot remain neutral on the question of religion but must show itself to be merciless towards it.</p>
<h2 id=when-was-the-collapse-of-the-soviet-union>When was the collapse of the Soviet Union?</h2>
<p>The collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991 furthered the spiritual progress, and in 2000 Tsar Nicholas II, the Russian emperor who had been murdered by the Bolsheviks after the October Revolution of 1917, and members of his family were canonized by the church.</p>
