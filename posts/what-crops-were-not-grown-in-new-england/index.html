<h2 id=what-crops-were-not-grown-in-new-england>What crops were not grown in New England?</h2>
<p>Farming was difficult in New England for crops like wheat because of the poor soil but corn, pumpkins, rye, squash and beans were planted. The Northern Colonies of New England concentrated in manufacture and focused on town life and industries such as ship building and the manufacture and export of rum.</p>
<h2 id=why-didnt-new-england-have-plantations>Why didnt New England have plantations?</h2>
<p>New England did not have such large plantations. There, it was more typical to have one or two enslaved individuals attached to a household, business, or small farm. In New England, it was common for enslaved people to learn specialized skills and crafts due to the area’s more varied economy.</p>
<h2 id=what-kind-of-crops-did-the-new-england-colonies-grow>What kind of crops did the New England colonies grow?</h2>
<p>Plantations in southern New England also included farming of beans, squash, and pumpkins, which were planted with the corn. Additionally, though the tobacco industry thrived to a much greater extent in Southern colonies, tobacco was also grown to a relatively lesser extent in New England. Other crops included melons and strawberries.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-geography-affect-the-economy-of-the-new-england-colonies>How did geography affect the economy of the New England colonies?</h2>
<p>There were very many fish at these grounds, In addition there were large areas covered with forests. This geography influenced New England’s economy greatly. In contrast to the Southern colonies, the New England colonies performed subsistence farming, or farming for survival not for selling.</p>
<h2 id=what-kind-of-crops-are-grown-in-england>What kind of crops are grown in England?</h2>
<p>Other notable crops grown across England include oats and corn as well as barley, which is mainly cultivated for feeding livestock, malted beverage production and other industrial purposes. Rapeseed is grown in abundance on English soil and is the source for canola oil for cooking.</p>
<h2 id=what-kind-of-products-does-new-england-export>What kind of products does New England export?</h2>
<p>Exports consist mostly of industrial products, including specialized machines and weaponry (aircraft and missiles especially), built by the region’s educated workforce. About half of the region’s exports consist of industrial and commercial machinery, such as computers and electronic and electrical equipment.</p>
