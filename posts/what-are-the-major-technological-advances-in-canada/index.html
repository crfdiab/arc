<h2 id=does-canada-have-good-technology>Does Canada have good technology?</h2>
<p>Canada is home to the world’s largest tech hubs, growing and attracting innovative talent from across the globe. Canada is increasingly recognized as a world leader in technology and the investments we make today and in the future will help ensure that Canada continues to be a pillar of innovation.</p>
<h2 id=how-advanced-is-canada>How advanced is Canada?</h2>
<p>Canada is one of the most socially advanced countries in the world, especially when it comes to opportunity for its citizens, though it has room for improvement in areas such as environmental sustainability and obesity rates.</p>
<h2 id=is-canada-advanced-in-technology>Is Canada advanced in technology?</h2>
<p>Despite not fostering innovation as well as other countries around the world, Canada continues to rise at a significant rate in the tech sector with each given year. And since many tech companies in Canada are relatively new startups, there is potential for significant revenue growth within Canada’s tech industry.</p>

In 2020, the sector’s GDP was $96.8 billion (in 2012 constant dollars), accounting for 5.1% of national GDP, continuing a trend of taking a higher share of national GDP. The ICT sector is also responsible for 27.2% of national GDP growth between 2015 and 2020.</p>
<h2 id=does-canada-have-better-technology-than-the-us>Does Canada have better technology than the US?</h2>
