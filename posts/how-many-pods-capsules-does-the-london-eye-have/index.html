<h2 id=how-many-pods-capsules-does-the-london-eye-have>How many pods capsules does the London Eye have?</h2>
<p>32 capsules<br>
The Eye has 32 capsules (one for each of the city’s 32 boroughs), but they’re numbered from one to 33. Why? As with many buildings and other structures, there is no No. 13 capsule—whether the superstition about that number is warranted or not, the cars skip from 12 to 14.</p>
<h2 id=can-you-take-bags-on-the-london-eye>Can you take bags on the London Eye?</h2>
<p>To make your visit as safe, secure and enjoyable as possible we have enhanced security checks in place. These include bag and personal belonging checks, which will be carried out for guests prior to entry. Bags and belongings will be searched [and screened] before being allowed in.</p>
<h2 id=are-there-32-pods-on-the-london-eye>Are there 32 pods on the London Eye?</h2>
<p>This means the whole idea to make 32 pods to represent the 32 London boroughs is a bit confusing. There are of course still 32 pods, but the numbers go up to 33. The London Eye, once known as the Millennium Wheel, was opened to the public in 2000, becoming Europe’s tallest cantilevered observation wheel.</p>
<h2 id=why-is-there-no-number-13-on-london-eye>Why is there no number 13 on London Eye?</h2>
<p>There is no pod labelled number 13 because 13 is seen by some as an unlucky number and so that number is missed out entirely. The pods go straight from number 12 to number 14. This means the whole idea to make 32 pods to represent the 32 London boroughs is a bit confusing.</p>
<h2 id=who-was-afraid-to-ride-the-london-eye>Who was afraid to ride the London Eye?</h2>
<p>The next day Salim, Ted and his older sister Kat decide to take a ride on the London Eye, bemoaning the hour-long queues. A stranger approaches them with a ticket for the Eye, saying he’s afraid of small spaces and cannot ride the Eye. They decide to give the ticket to Salim, as he has never been on the Eye before.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-kat-and-ted-find-out-about-london-eye>How did Kat and Ted find out about London Eye?</h2>
<p>The next day, Kat, Ted and their father visit the chemist to have the photographs developed. They then ride the Eye to see if there was any way that Salim could have hidden in the capsule or avoided getting out, but found no clues.</p>
