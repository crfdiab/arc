<h2 id=why-are-hurricanes-bad-for-the-environment>Why are hurricanes bad for the environment?</h2>
<p>Hurricanes and extreme extratropical storms cause elevated sea level, known as storm surge, and extensive shoreline erosion and other geologic effects leading to the loss of property and life.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-hurricane-and-its-effects>What is hurricane and its effects?</h2>
<p>When the winds in the wall clouds blow at speeds 210-240 km/hr, the combination of the winds, rain and the force of the ocean produces huge waves. These waves, known as storm surges, rise several feet above normal and cause floods on coastal areas. A storm surge is more destructive when it occurs at high tide.</p>
<h2 id=how-do-hurricanes-negatively-affect-humans>How do hurricanes negatively affect humans?</h2>
<p>Hurricanes effect people’s lives because they can do so much damage. Winds can damage houses, trees, and any outdoor property.

<h2 id=what-are-some-of-the-negative-effects-of-hurricanes>What are some of the negative effects of hurricanes?</h2>
<p>Negative Effects of hurricanes. Storm surge, tornadoes, heavy rainfall, high winds, riptide, and death are the most major effects of hurricanes. Storm surge. While a hurricane is approaching the coast, the sea level increases swiftly. Since the sea level rises, the amount of water can cause many deaths from drowning.</p>

<p>Positive Effects of Hurricanes: The positive effects of hurricanes are mentioned as follows. • These hurricanes could also be termed as the tropical cyclones.

<h2 id=what-happens-when-a-hurricane-hits-the-coast>What happens when a hurricane hits the coast?</h2>
<p>This happens when the hurricane reaches the coast. At this time, the sea level rises slowly which can cause deaths due to drowning or flooding the coastal areas. This low pressure of the storm and the strong winds cause suction that is responsible for this storm surge.</p>
