<h2 id=what-mountain-range-is-near-portland-oregon>What mountain range is near Portland Oregon?</h2>
<p>the Cascade Range<br>
Mount Hood, highest peak (11,239 feet [3,425 metres]) in Oregon, U.S., and the fourth highest peak in the Cascade Range, 45 miles (70 km) east-southeast of Portland.</p>
<h2 id=how-long-to-spend-at-mt-hood>How long to spend at Mt Hood?</h2>
<p>The total drive time is approximately three hours, so you’ll have time to for multiple stops. Keep in mind that the Gorge waterfall corridor around Multnomah Falls is extremely popular, especially on a weekend. But, here are some tips to help you beat those crowds and be rewarded with waterfalls and mountain views.</p>
<h2 id=can-you-swim-in-oregon-beaches>Can you swim in Oregon beaches?</h2>
<p>While there is no real official stand on this by Oregon tourism or state authorities, the general answer is: yes, you can swim in the Oregon coast’s Pacific Ocean.</p>
<h2 id=which-is-the-highest-mountain-range-in-oregon>Which is the highest mountain range in Oregon?</h2>
<p>To the east of the Willamette Lowlands stands the majestic Cascades Range. This chain of volcanic peaks includes several forested mountain ranges such as Mt. Jefferson, Mt. McLoughlin, and the Three Sisters. Marked on the map by an upright yellow triangle is Mount Hood – the state’s highest point, which rises to an elevation of 11,239ft (3,425m).</p>
<h2 id=what-kind-of-land-is-found-in-oregon>What kind of land is found in Oregon?</h2>
<p>As observed on the map, the Pacific Ocean coastline of the state is occupied by the rugged mountains (some over 1,000 ft. high), moist rainforests, and fertile valleys. In the southern part, the land rises into the Coastal Mountain Range and the Klamath Mountains.</p>
<h2 id=how-big-is-the-cascade-range-in-oregon>How big is the Cascade Range in Oregon?</h2>
<p>The Cascade mountain system extends from northern California to central British Columbia. In Oregon, it comprises the Cascade Range, which is 260 miles long and, at greatest breadth, 90 miles wide (fig. 1).</p>
<h2 id=where-are-the-willamette-mountains-located-in-oregon>Where are the Willamette Mountains located in Oregon?</h2>
<p>Both of these mountain ranges are a series of relatively low and heavily-forested peaks, that are in turn punctuated by numerous small lakes. Situated directly to the east of these mountains is the Willamette Lowlands – that stretch south, about 175 miles from the Portland area.</p>
