<h2 id=what-are-the-mountains-in-western-south-america>What are the mountains in western South America?</h2>
<p>Andes Mountains, also called the Andes, Spanish Cordillera de los Andes or Los Andes, mountain system of South America and one of the great natural features on Earth.</p>
<h2 id=what-mountains-run-down-the-western-side-of-south-america>What mountains run down the western side of South America?</h2>
<p>The Andes, Andes Mountains or Andean Mountains (Spanish: Cordillera de los Andes) are the longest continental mountain range in the world, forming a continuous highland along the western edge of South America.</p>
<h2 id=are-there-any-mountain-ranges-in-south-america>Are there any mountain ranges in South America?</h2>
<p>South American Mountain Ranges. Although there are a number of notable mountain ranges in South America, none come close to the scale and vastness of the Andes. In fact most South American ranges are just sub-ranges of the Andes. Below we take a brief look at the Andes and one of it’s sub-ranges, Cordillera Blanc.</p>
<h2 id=where-are-the-best-hiking-trails-in-south-america>Where are the best hiking trails in South America?</h2>
<p>With one of the longest mountain ranges in the World, South America is home to 100s of awesome hiking trails. Some of the most notable are those that take bucket-list adventurers on the Inca Trail to Machu Picchu or through the jagged mountains and turquoise lakes of Patagonia.</p>
<h2 id=which-is-the-second-highest-mountain-in-south-america>Which is the second highest mountain in South America?</h2>
<p>It had long been debated that Monte Pissis was South America’s second highest mountain, before the days where GPS measurements were a thing. This meant the top three highest peaks in South America had been switching places on the top spot for 30 or so years. The highest peak in Peru, and therefore the Earth’s Tropics, is the bad boy of the list.</p>
<h2 id=which-is-the-largest-mountain-range-in-peru>Which is the largest mountain range in Peru?</h2>
<p>The Cordillera Blanca (in English: ‘White Range’) is a Peruvian mountain range that is part of the wider Andes. The range is around 200km (124 miles) long and is home to many 6000m peaks, including the highest mountain in Peru, Huascarán (6,768m / 22,205ft).</p>
