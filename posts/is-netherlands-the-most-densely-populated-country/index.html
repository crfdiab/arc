<h2 id=is-netherlands-the-most-densely-populated-country>Is Netherlands the most densely populated country?</h2>
<p>People. With 17 million people and a population density of 488 people per km2, the Netherlands is the most densely populated country of the European Union and one of the mostly densely populated countries in the world.</p>
<h2 id=which-country-of-europe-has-the-highest-population-density>Which country of Europe has the highest population density?</h2>
<p>Spain<br>
This also helps explain why Spain has the most densely populated km² in Europe; more than 53,000 people inhabit a single 1km² area in Barcelona. France also has an area with more than 50,000 people in a single km², in Paris.</p>
<h2 id=why-is-the-netherlands-densely-populated>Why is the Netherlands densely populated?</h2>
<p>Because land is so scarce, any plot of land tends to have a high land price. Any labor including agricultural labor tends also tends to be expensive, because the Netherlands is densely populated and highly unionized.</p>
<h2 id=what-country-is-a-dutch-person-from>What country is a Dutch person from?</h2>
<p>the Netherlands<br>
Over time, English-speaking people used the word Dutch to describe people from both the Netherlands and Germany, and now just the Netherlands today. (At that point in time, in the early 1500s, the Netherlands and parts of Germany, along with Belgium and Luxembourg, were all part of the Holy Roman Empire.)</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-population-density-of-the-netherlands>What is the population density of the Netherlands?</h2>
<p>The Netherlands is the thirty-first most densely populated country in the world. The 17,000,000 Dutch men, women and children are concentrated on an area of 41,526 km2; this means that the country has a population density of 409 per km2 (August 2018:415 per km2), or over 502 per km2 if only the land area, 33,883 km2, is counted.</p>
<h2 id=which-is-the-country-with-the-highest-population-density>Which is the country with the highest population density?</h2>
<p>Sint Maarten (Population density: 1,234/km²) As the country with the world’s highest population, it is not surprising that the Chinese territory of Macau also has the world’s highest population density at 21,081/km².</p>
<h2 id=how-big-of-a-country-is-the-netherlands>How big of a country is the Netherlands?</h2>
<p>The Netherlands is the 27th most densely populated country of the world, concentrated over the country’s 41,526 square kilometers of surface area. The population is distributed as follows: 17.4% in the 0-14 age group, 67.7% in the 15-64 age group, and 14.9% in the age group of 65 and over.</p>
<h2 id=how-many-people-are-born-in-the-netherlands>How many people are born in the Netherlands?</h2>
<p>According to Eurostat, in 2010 there were 1,800,000 foreign-born residents in the Netherlands, corresponding to 11.1% of the total population. Of these, 1,400,000 (8.5%) were born outside the EU (including those from Dutch colonies) and 428,000 (2.6%) were born in another EU member state.</p>
