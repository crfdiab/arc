<h2 id=why-do-some-countries-use-more-renewable-energy>Why do some countries use more renewable energy?</h2>
<p>By developing such energy sources developing countries can reduce their dependence on oil and natural gas, creating energy portfolios that are less vulnerable to price rises. Renewable technologies can also help to displace other unsustainable energy sources such as kerosene lamps and traditional biomass.</p>
<h2 id=why-do-countries-use-different-energy-sources>Why do countries use different energy sources?</h2>
<p>Energy mix varies according to the energy resources available to a country – either as national resources or what it can import, choices over what it exploits (Germany and Japan are reducing their nuclear energy production), standard of living (the type of appliances that can be afforded by most people and the level of …</p>
<h2 id=why-is-renewable-energy-not-widely-used-in-many-countries>Why is renewable energy not widely used in many countries?</h2>
<p>Renewable energy often has trouble creating the same amount of power that fossil fuels make because of its inefficiency. Renewable energy is also not completely reliable even though it is sustainable. We cannot control when we receive it and how much we receive. It often relies on weather like the sun or water.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-best-reason-to-use-renewable-resources>What is the best reason to use renewable resources?</h2>
<p>Environmental and economic benefits of using renewable energy include: Generating energy that produces no greenhouse gas emissions from fossil fuels and reduces some types of air pollution. Diversifying energy supply and reducing dependence on imported fuels.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-biggest-energy-source-in-the-world>What is the biggest energy source in the world?</h2>
<p>Oil<br>
Oil is the world’s largest energy source today. It is the dominant source of energy for the transport sector in particular. This interactive map shows the share of primary energy that comes from oil across the world.</p>
<h2 id=what-countries-do-not-use-renewable-energy>What countries do not use renewable energy?</h2>
<p>Countries like the United Arab Emirates, Benin, Bahrain, Botswana, Kuwait, Libya, Mongolia, Oman, Qatar, Turkmenistan, Trinidad and Tobago, the Republic of Yemen, Saudi Arabia, Hong Kong, Brunei Darussalam, and Singapore are listed by the Data World Bank as countries with virtually 0% of their energy being sourced from …</p>
<h2 id=what-are-the-five-renewable-sources-used-most-often>What are the five renewable sources used most often?</h2>
<p>The most popular renewable energy sources currently are:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Solar energy.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Wind energy.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Hydro energy.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Tidal energy.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Geothermal energy.</p>

<h2 id=biomass-energy-which-is-an-example-of-a-renewable-resource>Biomass energy. Which is an example of a renewable resource?</h2>
<p>Examples of renewable resources are the sun, wind, and tidal energy. The resources which cannot be immediately replaced once they are depleted are called Non-renewable resources. Examples of Non-renewable resources include fossil fuels, such as coal, petroleum and natural gas and rare minerals typically found in meteorites.</p>
<h2 id=what-makes-the-worlds-energy-consumption-so-different>What makes the world’s energy consumption so different?</h2>
<p>What really makes a difference in the world’s energy consumption is how much energy each person consumes. When we consider this fact, we see that there is a big difference between the energy consumption of people living in developed nations as compared to those living in developing countries.</p>
<h2 id=whats-the-difference-between-renewable-and-non-renewable-energy>What’s the difference between renewable and non-renewable energy?</h2>
<p>Non-renewable energy includes fossil fuels such as coal and petroleum. Non-renewable energy has a comparatively higher carbon footprint and carbon emissions. The upfront cost of renewable energy is high.</p>
<h2 id=how-are-natural-resources-different-in-different-countries>How are natural resources different in different countries?</h2>
<p>Geography > Natural resources: Countries Compared. DEFINITION: A country’s mineral, petroleum, hydropower, and other resources of commercial importance.</p>
