<h2 id=how-did-people-move-to-the-great-plains>How did people move to the Great Plains?</h2>
<p>Settlers moved to the Great Plains for several reasons. One reason was the government was offering 160 acres of land for free if the settler agreed to live on the land for five years. This was part of the Homestead Act of 1862. Additionally, the government launched a campaign to attract settlers to this area.</p>

How did settlement from the east change the Great Plains?</li>
</ol>
<hr>
<p>Settlement from the East transformed the Great Plains. The huge herds of American bison that roamed the plains were almost wiped out, and farmers plowed the natural grasses to plant wheat and other crops. The cattle industry rose in importance as the railroad provided a practical means for getting the cattle to market.</p>
<h2 id=when-did-the-first-americans-come-to-the-great-plains>When did the first Americans come to the Great Plains?</h2>
<p>The first Americans (Paleo-Indians) who arrived to the Great Plains were successive indigenous cultures who are known to have inhabited the Great Plains for thousands of years, over 15,000 years ago. Humans entered the North American continent in waves of migration, mostly over Beringia, the Bering Straits land bridge.</p>
<h2 id=why-did-the-exodusters-come-to-the-great-plains>Why did the Exodusters come to the Great Plains?</h2>
<p>– The Exodusters were a South African American group that also moved to the Great Plains because of the promise of land. These settlers were given the name Exodusters because of their exodus, or mass departure, from the South.</p>
<h2 id=why-did-the-pioneers-of-the-great-plains-fear-nature>Why did the pioneers of the Great Plains fear nature?</h2>
<p>The grasshopper plagues that swept the Plains states in 1874 and 1876 were only one of the many natural hazards to induce fear, anxiety, and discouragement. Prairie fires, violent thunderstorms, occasional tornadoes, sudden blizzards, and hailstorms were among the most disturbing of nature’s trials to test the pioneers’ mettle.</p>
