<h2 id=does-guam-allow-same-sex-marriage>Does Guam allow same sex marriage?</h2>
<p>Same-sex marriage in Guam has been licensed and recognized since June 9, 2015, following a ruling of the District Court of Guam on June 5, 2015, that held the territory’s prohibition of same-sex marriage unconstitutional.</p>
<h2 id=is-the-legalization-of-same-sex-marriage-based-on-the-fourteenth-amendment>Is the legalization of same sex marriage based on the Fourteenth Amendment?</h2>
<p>Hodges is a landmark case in which on June 26, 2015, the Supreme Court of the United States held, in 5-4 decision, that state bans on same-sex marriage and on recognizing same sex marriages duly performed in other jurisdictions are unconstitutional under the Due Process and Equal Protection clauses of the Fourteenth …</p>
<h2 id=what-caused-obergefell-v-hodges>What caused Obergefell V Hodges?</h2>
<p>Due to the “substantial and continuing harm” and the “instability and uncertainty” caused by state marriage laws differing with regard to same-sex couples, and because respondent states had conceded that a ruling requiring them to marry same-sex couples would undermine their refusal to hold valid same-sex marriages …</p>
<h2 id=when-did-same-sex-marriage-become-legal-in-guam>When did same sex marriage become legal in Guam?</h2>
<h2 id=what-was-the-percentage-of-support-for-same-sex-marriage-in-2004>What was the percentage of support for same sex marriage in 2004?</h2>
<p>In Pew Research Center polling in 2004, Americans opposed same-sex marriage by a margin of 60% to 31%. Support for same-sex marriage has steadily grown over the past 15 years. And today, support for same-sex marriage remains near its highest point since Pew Research Center began polling on this issue.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-the-public-opinion-change-on-same-sex-marriage>How did the public opinion change on same sex marriage?</h2>
<p>As countries began to legalize same-sex partnerships, public opinion, particularly in Europe, began to shift in favour of full marriage rights for same-sex unions.</p>
<h2 id=which-is-the-first-country-to-legalize-same-sex-marriage>Which is the first country to legalize same sex marriage?</h2>
<p>Some jurisdictions opted to specifically apply the honorific of “marriage” to same-sex as well as heterosexual unions. In 2000 the Netherlands revised its same-sex partnership law and the following year became the first country to offer marriage to same-sex couples; several other European countries subsequently legalized gay marriage.</p>
