<h2 id=what-started-the-first-civilization>What started the first civilization?</h2>
<p>Civilization describes a complex way of life that came about as people began to develop networks of urban settlements. The earliest civilizations developed between 4000 and 3000 BCE, when the rise of agriculture and trade allowed people to have surplus food and economic stability.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-first-earliest-civilization>What was the first earliest civilization?</h2>
<p>Sumerian civilization<br>
The Sumerian civilization is the oldest civilization known to mankind. The term ���Sumer��� is today used to designate southern Mesopotamia. In 3000 BC, a flourishing urban civilization existed. The Sumerian civilization was predominantly agricultural and had community life.</p>
<h2 id=how-are-civilizations-formed>How are civilizations formed?</h2>
<p>In many parts of the world, early civilizations formed when people began coming together in urban settlements. From this specialization comes class structure and government, both aspects of a civilization. Another criterion for civilization is a surplus of food, which comes from having tools to aid in growing crops.</p>
<h2 id=why-did-civilization-start-in-the-middle-east>Why did civilization start in the Middle East?</h2>
<p>The middle east was the first place it could have started because of all the places on the planet it had the most wild grains and animals that could be domesticated. Wheat, Barley various legumes, sheep, cattle, goats.</p>
<h2 id=who-was-the-first-person-on-earths-name>Who was the first person on Earth’s name?</h2>
<p>Genesis 1 tells of God’s creation of the world and its creatures, with humankind as the last of his creatures: “Male and female created He them, and blessed them, and called their name Adam …” (Genesis 5:2).</p>
<h2 id=where-was-the-first-civilization-in-the-world>Where was the first civilization in the world?</h2>
<p>Sumer’s case can be argued upon: Location — established between the Tigris and Euphrates rivers in the ancient region of Mesopotamia. Sumer qualifies according to many written records as the birthplace of modern society. Agriculture — in the fertile crescent, the first signs of crop growing and animal husbandry appear.</p>
<h2 id=who-was-the-first-civilization-in-ancient-mesopotamia>Who was the first civilization in ancient Mesopotamia?</h2>
<p>The Sumerians were the first civilization of Ancient Mesopotamia. The first civilization on earth is a pivotal piece in the human origin story. Who were the first people to inspire humans all over the planet to start living in cities? When searching for the oldest civilization, defining which ancient societies qualify is a challenge.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-early-man-contribute-to-human-civilization>How did early man contribute to human civilization?</h2>
<p>For thousands of years after homo sapiens first appeared, early man laid the foundations for what would eventually become human civilization by developing agriculture, weaponry, art, social structure, and politics.</p>
<h2 id=are-there-any-civilizations-before-the-greeks-and-romans>Are there any civilizations before the Greeks and Romans?</h2>
<p>Both have shaped modern society in some way, whether it be their long-lasting social, cultural, or political influences. However, there are dozens of civilizations that have been around long before the Greeks and Romans made their stamp on human history.</p>
