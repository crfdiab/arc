<h2 id=what-did-industrialization-eventually-lead-to>What did industrialization eventually lead to?</h2>

<h2 id=what-are-3-things-industrialization-led-to>What are 3 things industrialization led to?</h2>
<p>Both Industrial Revolutions led to inventions that included the telephone, the steam engine, the sewing machine, the X-ray, the lightbulb, and the combustible engine. Working for businesses during the Industrial Revolution paid better wages than agricultural work.</p>
<h2 id=what-were-the-early-effects-of-industrialization>What were the early effects of industrialization?</h2>
<p>The creation of power machines and factories provided many new job opportunities. The new machinery increased production speed of good and gave people the ability to transport raw materials.

<h2 id=how-did-the-industrial-revolution-affect-the-20th-century>How did the Industrial Revolution affect the 20th century?</h2>
<p>While the Industrial Revolution resulted in many casualties and horrible disasters, it also resulted in the many successes of the 20th century. Without industrialization, there would never be a computer, or a car, or a camera, or the improved medicine that was developed.</p>
<h2 id=when-did-the-first-industrial-revolution-and-second-industrial-revolution-end>When did the first industrial revolution and Second Industrial Revolution end?</h2>
<p>The First Industrial Revolution, which ended in the middle of 19th century, was punctuated by a slowdown in important inventions before the Second Industrial Revolution in 1870.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-the-agricultural-revolution-lead-to-the-industrial-revolution>How did the agricultural revolution lead to the Industrial Revolution?</h2>
<p>The British Agricultural Revolution is considered one of the causes of the Industrial Revolution because improved agricultural productivity freed up workers to work in other sectors of the economy. However, per-capita food supply in Europe was stagnant or declining and did not improve in some parts of Europe until the late 18th century.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-dominant-industry-of-the-industrial-revolution>What was the dominant industry of the Industrial Revolution?</h2>
<p>Textiles were the dominant industry of the Industrial Revolution in terms of employment, value of output and capital invested. The textile industry was also the first to use modern production methods.</p>
