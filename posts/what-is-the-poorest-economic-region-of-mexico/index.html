<h2 id=what-is-the-poorest-economic-region-of-mexico>What is the poorest economic region of Mexico?</h2>
<p>According to the Instituto Nacional de Estadística y Geografía de México (INEGI, National Institute of Statistics and Geography), Chiapas is also the state with the highest poverty rate (74.7%) as well as extreme poverty (46.7%).</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-difference-between-northern-and-southern-mexico>What is the difference between northern and southern Mexico?</h2>
<p>Mexico’s southern states are more mountainous and rural than the north, with a bigger proportion of Indians. And on almost any socio-economic indicator, these areas lag behind the rest of the country. At the bottom are Chiapas, Oaxaca and Guerrero, but parts of Puebla and Veracruz are little better off.</p>
<h2 id=why-are-the-southern-states-of-mexico-poorer>Why are the southern states of Mexico poorer?</h2>
<p>Southern Mexico is generally poorer than the more developed northern part of the country for a number of reasons. Firstly, the three states contain larger indigenous populations compared to other Mexican states.</p>
<h2 id=how-big-is-the-economy-of-mexico-per-capita>How big is the economy of Mexico per capita?</h2>
<p>Currently, the economy of Mexico is the 15th largest in the world. In 2016, its nominal gross domestic product (GDP) was $1.1 trillion and GDP per capita was $8,700. Between 2001 and 2008, the economy grew at a small but steady pace. The global economic crisis of 2008 resulted in a GDP decline of more than 6%.</p>
<h2 id=why-is-the-economy-of-mexico-a-problem>Why is the economy of Mexico a problem?</h2>
<p>Future Economic Plans. Given that infrastructure is one of the biggest challenges faced by the economy of Mexico, it is also critical to the country’s future economic plans. As the manufacturing industry continues to increase production and output, the lack of infrastructure in Mexico will become a problem.</p>
<h2 id=which-is-the-poorest-state-in-mexico-by-gdp>Which is the poorest state in Mexico by GDP?</h2>
<p>The Poorest States In Mexico. With a poverty rate of 2012, Chiapas is the poorest Mexican state. Although it is a state of rich natural beauty, Chiapas currently has the highest poverty rate in the country. Mexico has the 11th largest GDP based on PPP and the 15th largest on nominal GDP.</p>
