<p>Months of Year in Chinese</p>

<h2 id=why-are-months-based-on-the-moon>Why are months based on the moon?</h2>
<p>The traditional concept arose with the cycle of Moon phases; such lunar months (“lunations”) are synodic months and last approximately 29.53 days. Synodic months, based on the Moon’s orbital period with respect to the Earth-Sun line, are still the basis of many calendars today, and are used to divide the year.</p>
<h2 id=how-are-lunar-months-named>How are lunar months named?</h2>
<p>Lunar months are measures from one New Moon to the next (although some groups reckon from the Full Moon). Each lunar month is given the name of the solar month in which the lunar month begins. Because most lunations are shorter than a solar month, there is occasionally a solar month in which two New Moons occur.</p>
<h2 id=how-do-you-say-8-in-chinese>How do you say 8 in Chinese?</h2>
<p>For example, twenty-five is expressed as 二十五 (èrshíwǔ), or “two-ten-five”. “Fourteen” is expressed as 十四 (shísì) or “ten-four.”…Chinese Numbers Are Easier Than English Numbers.</p>

<h2 id=whats-a-lunar-year>What’s a lunar year?</h2>
<p>A lunar year (used in some calendars) of 12 synodic months (12 cycles of lunar phases) is about 354 days long. A cosmic year is the time (about 225 million years) needed for the solar system to revolve once around the centre of the Milky Way…</p>

<p>12 months<br>
The Chinese calendar is basically lunar, its year consisting of 12 months of alternately 29 and 30 days, equal to 354 days, or approximately 12 full lunar cycles. Intercalary months have been inserted to keep the calendar year in step with the solar year of about 365 days.</p>
<h2 id=how-often-does-a-chinese-month-have-a-full-moon>How often does a Chinese month have a full moon?</h2>
<p>The Chinese calendar is based on lunar cycles or phases of the moon. Chinese months begin with new moon, and have a full moon on day 15. As a new moon comes roughly every 29½ days, Chinese calendar months always have 29 or 30 days.</p>
<h2 id=when-does-a-chinese-month-start-and-end>When does a Chinese month start and end?</h2>
<p>Chinese months begin with new moon, and have a full moon on day 15. As a new moon comes roughly every 29½ days, Chinese calendar months always have 29 or 30 days. ( Days: In the Chinese calendar, a day starts at midnight, but traditionally people regarded dawn as the beginning of a day.)</p>
<h2 id=when-did-the-lunar-month-begin-in-ancient-egypt>When did the lunar month begin in ancient Egypt?</h2>
<p>In ancient Egypt, the lunar month began on the day when the waning moon could no longer be seen just before sunrise. Others run from full moon to full moon. Yet others use calculation, of varying degrees of sophistication, for example, the Hebrew calendar or the ecclesiastical lunar calendar.</p>
<h2 id=where-did-the-name-of-the-moon-come-from>Where did the name of the Moon come from?</h2>
<p>The word moon can be traced to the word mōna, an Old English word from medieval times. Mōna shares its origins with the Latin words metri, which means to measure, and mensis, which means month. So, we see that the moon is called the moon because it is used to measure the months.</p>
