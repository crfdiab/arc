<p>They proposed that gravity is actually made of quantum particles, which they called “gravitons.” Anywhere there is gravity, there would be gravitons: on earth, in solar systems, and most importantly in the miniscule infant universe where quantum fluctuations of gravitons sprung up, bending pockets of this tiny space- …</p>

<p>Far more than just discovering the laws of gravity, Sir Isaac Newton was also responsible for working out many of the principles of visible light and the laws of motion, and contributing to calculus. increase of speed or velocity. to distinguish or mark as different. power or energy that activates movement.</p>
<h2 id=how-old-was-isaac-newton-when-he-died>How old was Isaac Newton when he died?</h2>
<p>In 1727, at 84, Sir Isaac Newton died in his sleep and was buried with pomp and ceremony in Westminster Abbey in London. Far more than just discovering the laws of gravity, Sir Isaac Newton was also responsible for working out many of the principles of visible light and the laws of motion, and contributing to calculus.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-name-of-isaac-newtons-book>What was the name of Isaac Newton’s Book?</h2>
<p>Newton published his findings in 1687 in a book called Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica (Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy) commonly known as the Principia.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-isaac-newton-come-up-with-law-of-universal-gravitation>How did Isaac Newton come up with law of universal gravitation?</h2>
<p>Newton theorized the same force that caused an apple to fall from a tree was also the force that kept the moon in place. Over several years, Newton worked until he had developed the law of universal gravitation, which debuted in his book Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy (1869).</p>
