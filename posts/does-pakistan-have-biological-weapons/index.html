<h2 id=does-pakistan-have-biological-weapons>Does Pakistan have biological weapons?</h2>
<p>Pakistan signed the Biological and Toxin Weapons Convention (BTWC) in 1972, and ratified it in 1974. [1] Although it has a well-developed biotechnology research and development infrastructure, there is no evidence of any Pakistani program to develop, produce, or stockpile biological weapons or agents.</p>
<h2 id=what-can-be-done-to-combat-bioterrorism>What can be done to combat bioterrorism?</h2>
<p>Elements of preparedness include vaccinating military personnel against anthrax and other diseases caused by biological weapons; developing methods for the rapid detection of biological threat agents; developing and stockpiling vaccines and antimicrobial drugs that could be used to protect the public against diseases …</p>

<p>Agro-terrorism and the Response of Industry Bioterrorism events can affect the agricultural industry directly or indirectly. Plants are usually sown on large areas. Unfortunately, these are very difficult to monitor. Contamination with infectious pathogens can result in contamination of other crops within a few days.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-the-3-bioterrorism-threat-levels>What are the 3 bioterrorism threat levels?</h2>
<p>The biological weapons as per the CDC classification are classified into three categories, Category A, B and C, as given in Table 1, based on the priority of the agents to pose a risk to the national security and the ease with which they can be disseminated [7].</p>
<h2 id=what-is-bioterrorism-and-agroterrorism>What is bioterrorism and agroterrorism?</h2>
<p>Agroterrorism: A subset of bioterrorism, defined as the deliberate introduction of animal or plant pests with the goal of generating fear, causing economic damage, and/or undermining social stability. 34. Biocrime: The threat or use of biological agents for individual objectives such as revenge or financial gain.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-relationship-between-bioterrorism-and-food>What is the relationship between bioterrorism and food?</h2>
<p>Bioterrorism and Food Safety. Food terrorism is an act or threat of deliberate contamination of food for human consumption with chemical, biological or radionuclear agents for the purpose of causing injury or death to civilian populations and/or disrupting social, economic or political stability.</p>
<h2 id=why-is-bioterrorism-a-concern-in-the-united-states>Why is bioterrorism a concern in the United States?</h2>
<p>Although once considered a remote concern, the possibility that a biological agent might be intentionally used to cause widespread panic, disease, and death is now a common concern.</p>
<h2 id=how-are-public-health-agencies-prepared-for-bioterrorism>How are public health agencies prepared for bioterrorism?</h2>
<p>State and local public health departments represent the backbone of our ability to respond effectively to a major outbreak of disease, including a bioterrorist attack. Yet these public health agencies have never been adequately supported or equipped to fulfill this mission.</p>
<h2 id=who-are-first-responders-in-case-of-bioterrorism>Who are first responders in case of bioterrorism?</h2>
<p>In fact, it may prove difficult to ever identify the perpetrators or the site of release–or even to determine whether the disease outbreak was intentional or naturally occurring. The first responders to a bioterroism event would be public health officials and health care workers.</p>
