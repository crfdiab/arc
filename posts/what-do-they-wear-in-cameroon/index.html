<h2 id=what-do-they-wear-in-cameroon>What do they wear in Cameroon?</h2>
<p>Traditional clothing in Cameroon includes the Kabba, Sanja, Turbins, and other body dresses worn by both men and women of different ethnic backgrounds. For example, the kabba is mostly worn among the Duala, Bakweri, Bakossi, Bassossi and other groups in the South West and Littoral regions of Cameroon.</p>
<h2 id=what-do-teenagers-do-in-cameroon>What do teenagers do in Cameroon?</h2>
<p>Teenagers in Cameroon are not very independent and are mostly dependent on their parents. Teenagers in Cameroon are expected to take responsibility for their personal hygiene and academic life, and to also participate in the care of younger children.</p>
<h2 id=do-soldiers-wear-uniforms>Do soldiers wear uniforms?</h2>
<p>All soldiers will wear the Army uniform when on duty, unless granted an exception to wear civilian clothes. The following personnel may grant exceptions: Commanders of major Army commands (MACOMs).</p>
<h2 id=why-did-soldiers-wear-uniforms>Why did soldiers wear uniforms?</h2>
<p>Uniforms are also an important part of military service. Soldiers wear uniforms to increase identification with their fellow soldiers and their mission. Their uniforms also provide important protection and, sometimes, camouflage to help them do their jobs.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-life-like-in-cameroon>What is life like in Cameroon?</h2>
<p>Cameroon is in trouble. The country is economically plagued by a devastatingly high poverty rate, struggling education and health care systems, paralyzing corruption and various internal rifts that threaten national security and any prospects of a vibrant tourism industry.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-cameroon-known-for>What is Cameroon known for?</h2>
<p>Cameroon is often known as “Africa in miniature” because of its geographical and cultural diversity. The Central African country has one of the highest literacy rates on the continent, but its economic progress has been hampered by corruption and decades of authoritarian rule.</p>
<h2 id=is-it-okay-to-wear-army-shirt>Is it okay to wear army shirt?</h2>
<p>Absolutely not, t-shirts, hats and even Field Jackets are ok, especially if you are representing a relative, or simply showing respect. However, do NOT wear any rank, medals or decorations that they might have won.</p>
<h2 id=do-you-salute-indoors-army>Do you salute indoors army?</h2>
<p>You don’t have to salute indoors, except when you report to a superior officer. If either person is wearing civilian clothes and you do not recognize the other person as a superior officer, salutes are unnecessary. Use common sense.</p>
<h2 id=why-are-uniforms-bad>Why are uniforms bad?</h2>
<p>The most common argument against school uniforms is that they limit personal expression. Many students who are against school uniforms argue that they lose their self-identity when they lose their right to express themselves through fashion. The courts have even weighed in on this.</p>
<h2 id=can-a-civilian-wear-military-uniform>Can a civilian wear military uniform?</h2>
<p>TLDR – In the United States, it is legal for civilians to wear military uniforms. However, it is against the law to impersonate a member of the military for personal gains, such as wearing a uniform to commit fraud.</p>
<h2 id=how-old-do-you-have-to-be-to-go-to-school-in-cameroon>How old do you have to be to go to school in Cameroon?</h2>
<p>Education is compulsory through the age of 12 years. Primary school education has been free since 2000; however, families must pay for uniforms and book fees.</p>
<h2 id=are-there-any-state-run-universities-in-cameroon>Are there any state run universities in Cameroon?</h2>
<p>Although Cameroon boasts a sprawling cache of junior academic institutions of excellence, higher institutions are rather insufficient. There are eight state-run universities in Buea, Bamenda, Douala, Dschang, Maroua and Ngaoundere and Yaounde I & II.</p>
<h2 id=why-are-there-fewer-girls-than-boys-in-cameroon>Why are there fewer girls than boys in Cameroon?</h2>
<p>There are fewer girls than boys, mainly due to such things as early marriage, pregnancy, domestic chores, and traditional biases. On the back of this, the Cameroonian government launched a programme of construction and renewal, but with limited success. Corruption is still a problem and facilities remain basic.</p>
<h2 id=which-is-the-primary-language-of-instruction-in-cameroon>Which is the primary language of instruction in Cameroon?</h2>
<p>English is now considered the primary language of instruction. Local languages are generally not taught as there are too many, and choosing between them would raise further issues. Christian mission schools have played a significant role in educating children whose parents can afford them. But most cannot.</p>
