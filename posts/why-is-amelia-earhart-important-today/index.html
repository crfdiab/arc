<h2 id=why-is-amelia-earhart-important-today>Why is Amelia Earhart important today?</h2>
<p>Amelia Earhart was the first woman to fly solo across the Atlantic Ocean. Amelia Earhart’s legacy lives on not only through her flying accomplishments and contributions to American aviation, but through her work to motivate women to pursue their careers and her support of the Equal Rights Amendment as well.</p>
<h2 id=what-did-amelia-earhart-receive-in-1923>What did Amelia Earhart receive in 1923?</h2>
<p>In 1923, Earhart became the 16th woman to receive an official Fédération Aéronautique Internationale pilot license.</p>
<h2 id=why-was-amelia-earhart-important-to-american-history>Why was Amelia Earhart important to American history?</h2>
<p>Americans have been fascinated, time after time, with the ability to fly. One woman in particular took her fascinations and abilities and became one of the greatest aviators of her time. Amelia Earhart was a very famous, record-setting woman aviator.</p>
<h2 id=where-did-amelia-earhart-go-to-college-after-world-war-1>Where did Amelia Earhart go to college after World War 1?</h2>
<p>After the war, she returned to the United States and enrolled at Columbia University in New York as a pre-med student. Earhart took her first airplane ride in California in December 1920 with famed World War I pilot Frank Hawks—and was forever hooked. In January 1921, she started flying lessons with female flight instructor Neta Snook.</p>
<h2 id=when-did-amelia-earhart-start-her-flying-laboratory>When did Amelia Earhart start her flying laboratory?</h2>
<p>In 1929, Earhart helped found the Ninety-Nines, an organization of female aviators. In 1935, Purdue University hired Earhart as aviation advisor and career counselor for women and purchased the Lockheed plane she dubbed her “flying laboratory.”</p>
<h2 id=why-was-amelia-earhart-awarded-the-distinguished-flying-cross>Why was Amelia Earhart awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross?</h2>
<p>Upon returning to the United States, Congress awarded her the Distinguished Flying Cross—a military decoration awarded for “heroism or extraordinary achievement while participating in an aerial flight.” She was the first woman to receive the honor. Later that year, Earhart made the first solo, nonstop flight across the United States by a woman.</p>
