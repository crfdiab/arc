<p>Sweet cherries These are best grown in the Upper South, preferably in the Appalachian and Blue Ridge Mountains. They are the most common market type, but their high chilling requirement (many hours needed below 45F) makes them poorly adapted to most of the South.</p>
<h2 id=what-trees-are-native-to-the-rio-grande-valley>What trees are native to the Rio Grande Valley?</h2>
<ul>
<li>Allthorn or Junco – Koeberlinia spinosa.</li>

<h2 id=what-does-cedar-elm-look-like>What does cedar elm look like?</h2>
<p>Cedar elm is a large, oval-rounded tree growing 50-70 ft. Leaves much smaller than those of the American Elm, Fall foliage is yellow except in the southern part of the range where it is evergreen. Tree with rounded crown of drooping branches and the smallest leaves of any native elm.</p>
<h2 id=can-i-grow-a-cherry-tree-in-florida>Can I grow a cherry tree in Florida?</h2>
<p>Trees and plants with the common name “cherry” grow in Florida, but traditional cherry trees of the genus Prunus, with their distinctive, small fleshy fruits, require cold temperatures and more chilling hours than the Florida climate provides.</p>
<h2 id=can-i-grow-a-cherry-tree-in-texas>Can I grow a cherry tree in Texas?</h2>
<p>Growing a cherry tree in the arid Texas climate may seem like a challenging feat for any gardener. However, cherries have been, and continue to be, successfully grown in Texas. A handful of cherry tree varieties are native to Texas and grow particularly well.</p>
<h2 id=do-you-need-2-cherry-trees-to-produce-fruit>Do you need 2 cherry trees to produce fruit?</h2>
<p>Only one sour cherry tree needs to be planted for pollination and fruit set. Cross-pollination is the transfer of pollen from one plant to the flower of a different variety. When planting self-unfruitful cultivars, at least two different sweet cherry varieties must be planted for fruit production.</p>
<h2 id=can-cherries-grow-in-hot-weather>Can cherries grow in hot weather?</h2>
<p>There are two key issues with growing cherries in hot climates, Andersen said: Lack of chill hours and heat tolerance during flower bud initiation. When sweet cherries don’t get enough hours of temperatures below 40˚F, they don’t grow or flower normally. Chill hours requirement is a trait that breeders can select for.</p>
<h2 id=what-grows-in-the-rio-grande-valley>What grows in the Rio Grande Valley?</h2>
<p>The Lower Rio Grande Valley area of Texas is in the southern region of the state, in the area surrounding the Rio Grande River. The arid climate is conducive to growing citrus, sugar cane, potatoes, spinach, and other heat-tolerant vegetables.</p>

<h2 id=what-kind-of-fertilizer-to-use-for-cherry-trees-in-texas>What kind of fertilizer to use for cherry trees in Texas?</h2>
