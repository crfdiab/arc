<h2 id=why-is-the-population-in-ireland-increasing>Why is the population in Ireland increasing?</h2>
<p>Population change is driven by three elements – births, deaths and net migration (immigration less emigration). Births less deaths is known as natural increase. During the most recent inter-censal period 2011 to 2016 natural increase has continued to be the main driver of population growth in Ireland.</p>
