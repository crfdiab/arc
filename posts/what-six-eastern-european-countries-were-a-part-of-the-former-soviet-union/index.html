<h2 id=what-six-eastern-european-countries-were-a-part-of-the-former-soviet-union>What six Eastern European countries were a part of the former Soviet Union?</h2>
<p>In Western Europe, the term Eastern Bloc generally referred to the USSR and its satellite states in the Comecon (East Germany, Poland, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Romania, Bulgaria, and Albania); in Asia, the Soviet Bloc comprised the Mongolian People’s Republic, the Socialist Republic of Vietnam, the Lao People’s …</p>
<h2 id=what-countries-were-part-of-the-ussr>What countries were part of the USSR?</h2>
<p>In the decades after it was established, the Russian-dominated Soviet Union grew into one of the world’s most powerful and influential states and eventually encompassed 15 republics–Russia, Ukraine, Georgia, Belorussia, Uzbekistan, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Moldova, Turkmenistan, Tajikistan, Latvia.</p>

<p>FORMER SOVIET COUNTRIES: A RETURN TO THE OLD WAYS? Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Malta, Poland, the Czech Republic, Slovakia and Slovenia, all due to join the EU on 1 May 2004, respected press freedom.</p>
<h2 id=why-didnt-the-us-invade-the-soviet-union-after-ww2>Why didn’t the US invade the Soviet Union after ww2?</h2>
<p>They didn’t invade the Soviet Union because they could not possibly have won. Quoting British General Staff, the odds of victory were “fanciful”. Defeating a battered and beleaguered Wermacht had taken massive effort on the part of the Western Allies.</p>

<h2 id=did-the-us-and-ussr-ever-fully-trust-each-other>Did the US and USSR ever fully trust each other?</h2>
<p>Did the United States and the USSR ever fully trust one other? No, they had disagreements, US concerned about about spread of communism, and Stalin’s tolalitarian rule. The USSR was angry that the US hesitated to treat it as part of international community, and they were slow in entering World War II.</p>
<h2 id=could-the-soviets-have-won-ww2-alone>Could the Soviets have won ww2 alone?</h2>
<p>So, rant over, long story short, no, Russia did not win WWII by themselves, they couldn’t have won it by themselves even if they’d wanted to, the Soviets were only kept in the fight at all because of American industry and aid, and only got into the mess they did at all because Stalin liked the cut of the Nazi’s jib.</p>

<h2 id=who-are-the-successor-states-of-the-soviet-union>Who are the successor states of the Soviet Union?</h2>
<p>The post-Soviet states, also collectively known as the former Soviet Union (FSU) or former Soviet Republics, are the states that emerged and re-emerged from the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics in its breakup in 1991, with Russia internationally recognised as the successor state to the Soviet Union after the Cold War.</p>
