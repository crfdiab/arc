<h2 id=why-was-the-great-stink-in-london-dangerous>Why was the Great Stink in London dangerous?</h2>
<p>The Great Stink was an event in Central London in July and August 1858 during which the hot weather exacerbated the smell of untreated human waste and industrial effluent that was present on the banks of the River Thames.</p>
<h2 id=who-stopped-the-great-stink>Who stopped the Great Stink?</h2>
<p>One of the most vocal and well-known supporters of Thames reform was an English chemist and physicist named Michael Faraday. He staunchly supported a complete reformation of the toxic river, so much so that after a boat ride along its surface, he composed and sent a letter to the editor of The Times newspaper.</p>
<h2 id=who-caused-the-great-stink>Who caused the Great Stink?</h2>
<p>Investigating cholera’s spread in Soho in 1854, the physician Dr John Snow deduced that the cause was contaminated water. His evidence included the 70 workers in the local brewery who only drank beer and all survived. Yet public health officials were slow to be convinced.</p>
<h2 id=what-diseases-were-caused-by-the-great-stink>What diseases were caused by the Great Stink?</h2>
<p>Many blamed the fetid smell that hung over the River Thames – by this time little more than an enormous sewer. In reality cholera is a waterborne disease. It was carried in the sewage polluting the city’s watercourses and passed to the capital’s population when they ingested polluted water.</p>
<h2 id=how-many-deaths-did-the-great-stink-cause>How many deaths did the Great Stink cause?</h2>
<p>6,536 people died in London, and an estimated 20,000 nationally, as a result of this outbreak. During the second major epidemic in 1848 the death toll in London more than doubled.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-the-great-stink-affect-the-people-of-london>How did the Great Stink affect the people of London?</h2>
<p>Between 1831 and 1854, three cholera epidemics hit the city, each killing thousands of Londoners. Now, people across the city believed that they could get cholera once more from the Great Stink. William Heath/Wellcome Images/Wikimedia Commons “Monster Soup commonly called Thames Water.”</p>
<h2 id=when-was-the-great-stink-and-the-great-smog>When was the Great Stink and the Great Smog?</h2>
<p>But there were two times in London’s history when the air became not just foul-smelling but actually deadly: the Great Stink and the Great Smog. Effingham Wilson.</p>
<h2 id=how-many-people-died-in-the-great-smog-of-london>How many people died in the Great Smog of London?</h2>
<p>Government medical reports in the weeks following the event estimated that up to 4,000 people had died as a direct result of the smog and 100,000 more were made ill by the smog’s effects on the human respiratory tract.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-the-great-stink-affect-the-thames-river>How did the Great Stink affect the Thames River?</h2>
<p>They also began to realize that simply relocating the seat of government would not do anything to alleviate the suffering of the people who could not move away from the toxic Thames. Within a record of eighteen days, a bill was created, passed, and signed into law that would refurbish the entirety of the River Thames.</p>
