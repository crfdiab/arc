<h2 id=what-effect-would-the-lack-of-oxygen-have-on-living-organisms>What effect would the lack of oxygen have on living organisms?</h2>
<p>Zones of low oxygen in the water—often called dead zones—can hurt the growth, reproduction and survival of fish and other animals. They can alter food webs in our estuaries and coastal oceans.</p>
<h2 id=what-happens-to-oxygen-in-a-dead-zone>What happens to oxygen in a dead zone?</h2>
<p>Less oxygen dissolved in the water is often referred to as a “dead zone” because most marine life either dies, or, if they are mobile such as fish, leave the area. The decomposition process consumes oxygen and depletes the supply available to healthy marine life.</p>
<h2 id=does-low-oxygen-levels-contribute-to-dead-zones>Does low oxygen levels contribute to dead zones?</h2>
<p>Dead zones are areas of water bodies where aquatic life cannot survive because of low oxygen levels. Dead zones are generally caused by significant nutrient pollution, and are primarily a problem for bays, lakes and coastal waters since they receive excess nutrients from upstream sources.</p>
<h2 id=how-does-lack-of-oxygen-affect-plants>How does lack of oxygen affect plants?</h2>
<p>Under low oxygen stress, plants reconfigurate their metabolism to maximize ATP production. Three fermentative pathways are activated using the pyruvate as a starting substrate, deriving from sugar catabolism and glycolysis.</p>
<h2 id=how-does-low-supply-of-oxygen-affect-the-cow>How does low supply of oxygen affect the cow?</h2>
<p>Answer: The overall results indicate that a low-oxygen condition decreases P4 synthesis by attenuating P450scc production and P450scc activity in bovine luteal cells and suggest that oxygen deficiency is an essential condition for the progression of luteolysis in cattle.</p>
<h2 id=what-activities-cause-hypoxia>What activities cause hypoxia?</h2>
<p>Hypoxia occurs most often, however, as a consequence of human-induced factors, especially nutrient pollution (also known as eutrophication). The causes of nutrient pollution, specifically of nitrogen and phosphorus nutrients, include agricultural runoff, fossil-fuel burning, and wastewater treatment effluent.</p>
<h2 id=what-conditions-would-cause-low-oxygen-levels-in-soil>What conditions would cause low oxygen levels in soil?</h2>
<p>Conditions that favor development of oxygen starvation are heavy, compacted, poorly drained clay soils, periods of high rainfall, snowmelt, excessive irrigation, or flooding during the growing season.</p>
<h2 id=what-happens-to-your-body-when-you-have-low-oxygen-levels>What happens to your body when you have low oxygen levels?</h2>
<p>Low oxygen levels will rob you of your eye sight, short term memory, and your energy. Eventually low oxygen levels will weaken your heart muscle. Heart Failure IS -> Progressive weakening of your heart muscle! (Read that sentence again. It is that important.) The world is facing an epidemic of heart failure!</p>
<h2 id=what-causes-dissolved-oxygen-in-water-to-be-low>What causes dissolved oxygen in water to be low?</h2>
<p>Dissolved oxygen depletion can occur for several naturally occurring reasons, most of which are highly preventable or treatable (dissolved oxygen depletion can occur with pollution of the water, but this will be covered in a future post).</p>
<h2 id=how-does-low-dissolved-oxygen-affect-fish-populations>How does low dissolved oxygen affect fish populations?</h2>
<p>As the top layer of water cools from either a heavy rain storm or a cold front the water then mixes or “turnsover” with the deep, oxygen deficient water and a pond wide oxygen depletion can occur and harm fish populations, possibly even causing die-offs.</p>
<h2 id=what-happens-to-the-brain-when-there-is-no-oxygen>What happens to the brain when there is no oxygen?</h2>
<p>After three minutes, the neurons experience severe damage, this is usually irreversible. After five minutes, the chances of death are fast approaching. After ten minutes, even if the brain receives some oxygen and stays alive, the person will become a vegetable in a coma, with permanent brain damage.</p>
