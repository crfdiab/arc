<h2 id=where-in-the-world-is-scarlet-fever-most-common>Where in the world is scarlet fever most common?</h2>
<p>Reports of cases of scarlet fever have been on the rise in countries including England, Wales, South Korea, Vietnam, China, and Hong Kong in recent years. Researchers are unsure as to what has caused the spike in cases of the disease.</p>
<h2 id=where-does-scarlet-fever-originate-from>Where does scarlet fever originate from?</h2>
<p>Scarlet fever, once common in England and Wales in the mid-nineteenth century, has recently resurged in England. Now, in a new study, Public Health England researchers have sought to find out the cause of the biggest increase in scarlet fever cases England has seen in several decades.</p>
<h2 id=who-is-most-affected-by-scarlet-fever>Who is most affected by scarlet fever?</h2>
<p>Children 5 to 15 years of age are more likely than are other people to get scarlet fever. Scarlet fever germs spread more easily among people in close contact, such as family members or classmates.</p>
<h2 id=why-is-scarlet-fever-so-rare>Why is scarlet fever so rare?</h2>
<p>The rash of scarlet fever is caused by a toxin that the strep bacteria produce. Scarlet fever once was common among children ages 2 to 10, but now it is relatively rare. The reason for this remains a mystery, especially because there has been no decrease in the number of cases of strep throat or strep skin infections.</p>
<h2 id=is-scarlet-fever-coming-back-2020>Is scarlet fever coming back 2020?</h2>
<p>Conclusion. Scarlet fever, a historic disease, is making a comeback in a select few countries and scientists are unsure why. Whether or not this trend will continue into 2020 remains to be seen, but affected countries and the public health community should rally to address this re-emerging threat head on.</p>
<h2 id=how-many-have-died-from-scarlet-fever>How many have died from scarlet fever?</h2>
<p>Fatalities from scarlet fever are uncommon; only five deaths from streptococcal sore throat and scarlatina were reported in the U.S. in 1983.</p>
<h2 id=can-scarlet-fever-cause-problems-later-in-life>Can scarlet fever cause problems later in life?</h2>
<p>In general, appropriately diagnosed and treated scarlet fever results in few if any long-term effects. However, if complications develop for whatever reason, problems that include kidney damage, hepatitis, vasculitis, septicemia, congestive heart failure, and even death may occur.</p>
<h2 id=can-i-go-to-work-if-my-child-has-scarlet-fever>Can I go to work if my child has scarlet fever?</h2>
<p>If your child has scarlet fever, keep them away from nursery or school for at least 24 hours after starting treatment with antibiotics. Adults with the illness should also stay off work for at least 24 hours after starting treatment.</p>
<h2 id=does-scarlet-fever-have-to-be-reported>Does scarlet fever have to be reported?</h2>
<p>Even though scarlet fever does not have to be reported to the CDC, Lamagni said a surge in the United States would be hard to miss.</p>
<h2 id=what-causes-scarlet-fever-and-what-causes-scarlatina>What causes scarlet fever and what causes scarlatina?</h2>
<p>Scarlet fever, or scarlatina as it is called by some people, is caused by bacteria called group A Streptococcus or group A strep. The rash is caused by a poison (toxin) made by the bacteria.</p>
<h2 id=are-there-any-cases-of-scarlet-fever-in-the-us>Are there any cases of scarlet fever in the US?</h2>
<p>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention does not track cases of scarlet fever in the United States. Spicehandler said although she is not a pediatrician, she hasn’t heard of an uptick of cases in the U.S. so far.</p>
<h2 id=how-old-do-you-have-to-be-to-get-scarlet-fever>How old do you have to be to get scarlet fever?</h2>
<p>Anyone can get scarlet fever, but there are some factors that can increase the risk of getting this infection. Scarlet fever, like strep throat, is more common in children than adults. It is most common in children 5 through 15 years old.</p>
<h2 id=what-causes-scarlet-fever-if-you-have-strep-throat>What causes scarlet fever if you have strep throat?</h2>
<p>The infection is caused by a poison (toxin) produced by a bacterium called group A beta hemolytic Streptococcus. Some people are more sensitive to the toxin than others, so not everyone in a family who is infected will have the scarlet fever rash, even if they have the Strep throat infection.</p>
