<h2 id=what-is-the-name-of-the-group-that-preacher-beecher-gave-rifles>What is the name of the group that preacher Beecher gave rifles?</h2>
<p>Beecher armed the parishioners with Bibles, and rifles as well. They were called the New Haven Colony but became better known as the Beecher Rifle Colony, organizing a congregation in Wabaunsee County.</p>
<h2 id=what-happened-with-the-sharps-rifle-and-john-brown-in-kansas>What happened with the Sharps rifle and John Brown in Kansas?</h2>
<p>Soon the Sharps rifles sent to Kansas were referred to as “Beecher’s Bibles.” In 1856, after abolitionists were attacked in Lawrence, John Brown led a raid on scattered cabins along the Pottawatomie Creek, killing five people. Two days later Robert E. Lee and his troops overran the raiders and captured John Brown.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-beecher-rifle-colony>What was the Beecher rifle colony?</h2>
<p>The town of Wabaunsee was founded in 1855 by a group of about 70 New England emigrants from New Haven, Connecticut who established the Connecticut Kansas Colony, alternatively called the New Haven Colony or the Beecher Rifle Colony.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-its-connection-with-the-beecher-bible-amp-rifle-church>What was its connection with the Beecher Bible & Rifle church?</h2>
<p>A famous New York preacher, Henry Ward Beecher, raised money for the cause and sent crates of rifles and bibles to the colonists. According to legend, the rifles were covered with bibles so as to get through the pro-slavery state of Missouri. In 1856, the Connecticut colonists came to Wabaunsee.</p>
<h2 id=what-kind-of-rifle-was-beechers-bible-used-for>What kind of rifle was Beecher’s Bible used for?</h2>
<p>” Beecher’s Bible ” was the name given to the breech-loading Sharps rifle that was supplied to and used by the anti-slavery combatants in Kansas, during the Bleeding Kansas period (1854–1860).</p>
<h2 id=what-did-john-beecher-do-for-the-abolitionists>What did John Beecher do for the abolitionists?</h2>
<p>Beecher himself contributed funds for the purchase of Sharps carbines and, after the interception of shipments by pro-slavery men, is said to have issued carbines and real Bibles to individual abolitionists bound for Kansas.</p>
<h2 id=what-kind-of-rifle-was-the-henry-repeating>What kind of rifle was the Henry Repeating?</h2>
<p>The result was the legendary repeating rifle that became known as the 1860 Henry, in.44 Henry Rimfire. A pioneering design in a reliable and practical lever action repeater, and adopted in limited numbers during the Civil War, the Henry was the 16-shot rifle referred to as “the rifle you could load on Sunday and shoot all week long.”</p>
<h2 id=why-was-the-railroad-important-to-the-settlers-of-kansas>Why was the railroad important to the settlers of Kansas?</h2>
<p>Railroads offered free or reduced-rate transportation to Kansas, and settlers from overseas could bring all of their household goods at a railroad’s expense. It wasn’t always a pleasant way to travel.</p>
