<p>6. The breeding period increases from north to south. Breeding occurs for at least 57 days in the north, 60 days in central Arkansas and 73 days in the south.</p>
<h2 id=how-do-you-know-when-the-rut-starts>How do you know when the rut starts?</h2>
<p>Older bucks rub their antlers on trees more often than younger bucks. The closer it gets to rut season, the deeper those rubs will get. They will eventually turn into scrapes. Then, once you stop seeing deer around the scraping areas, that’s the indicator that rut is about to start.</p>
<h2 id=is-the-rut-on-in-arkansas>Is the rut on in Arkansas?</h2>
<p>The average peak of the rut in Arkansas is Nov. 11, he added, which is why Arkansas always opens modern gun deer season on the second Saturday of November.</p>
<h2 id=whats-the-best-time-for-deer-movement-today>What’s the best time for deer movement today?</h2>
<p>No matter what the conditions, deer move best early of a morning and late of an afternoon. That’s when they’re wired to move most. It’s when their eyesight is most effective. And there are few things that impact this movement, other than pressure.</p>
<h2 id=what-triggers-the-rut-in-deer>What triggers the rut in deer?</h2>
<p>The bow season opened four weeks ago, but deer activity is only now intensifying. It is called the “rut” — the breeding season for whitetail deer. Photoperiod (amount of daylight each day) is what triggers females to come into estrus, and the does dictate rutting activity.</p>
<h2 id=does-human-urine-attract-deer>Does human urine attract deer?</h2>
<p>“But it’s unlikely deer associate human urine with humans, unless a human leaves their scent behind along with the urine.” Miller agrees. “Deer aren’t genetically programmed to be able to identify human urine.</p>
<h2 id=when-does-the-whitetail-rut-start-and-end>When does the whitetail rut start and end?</h2>
<p>Because the length of daylight is always the same for a given day every year, the photoperiod approach makes the whitetail rut timing very predictable. According to the QDMA study the average center of breeding fell within a 7 day period every single year, and for eight of the nine years it fell in the same 4 day period.</p>
<h2 id=when-does-the-rut-usually-start-in-arkansas>When does the rut usually start in Arkansas?</h2>
<p>The “Rut” or breeding period of a buck deer can be a long time event. Most people, when referring to the “Rut” are implying the peak, most of the time that is late October thru mid November here in Central Arkansas. North or South could be some earlier or latter by a few days or a week.</p>

<h2 id=when-is-the-best-day-to-hunt-whitetail-deer>When is the best day to hunt whitetail deer?</h2>
<p>Through experience veteran deer hunters have a day marked on the calendar that in their hunting area is the best day to be in the stand. I have one, and its Nov. 6 th in my area.</p>
