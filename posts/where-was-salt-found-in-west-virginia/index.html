<h2 id=where-was-salt-found-in-west-virginia>Where was salt found in West Virginia?</h2>
<p>Kanawha Valley<br>
A 7th generation salt-making family harvests an all-natural salt by hand, from an ancient ocean trapped below the Appalachian Mountains of the Kanawha Valley in West Virginia.</p>
<h2 id=how-much-salt-does-west-virginia-produce-a-year>How much salt does West Virginia produce a year?</h2>
<p>They upped production, and today J.Q. Dickinson Salt-Works produces about 16,000 pounds of salt a year.</p>
<h2 id=is-there-an-ocean-underneath-the-state-of-west-virginia>Is there an ocean underneath the state of West Virginia?</h2>
<p>Did you know there’s a 400-million-year-old ocean beneath West Virginia? It’s called the Iapetus Ocean, and it lies underneath the beautiful Appalachian Mountains. Today, this ancient ocean continues to present a unique opportunity to a business in the Kanawha Valley area of the state.</p>
<h2 id=why-did-booker-t-washington-work-in-a-salt-mine>Why did Booker T Washington work in a salt mine?</h2>
<p>Washington channeled the desire he felt as a young man working in the salt works in West Virginia into his future role as educator and as a national leader for the promotion of African American education. You can visit the West Virginia and Regional History Center to see books written by and about Booker T.</p>
<h2 id=are-there-salt-mines-in-west-virginia>Are there salt mines in West Virginia?</h2>
<p>Today there are three principal salt-producing companies in the State, two in Marshall County and one in Tyler County. All three companies extract rock salt, most of which is sent to chemical companies along the Kanawha River.</p>
<h2 id=what-did-booker-t-washington-learn-from-mrs-ruffner>What did Booker T Washington learn from Mrs Ruffner?</h2>
<p>Washington learns order and cleanliness from Mrs. Ruffner, as well as a notion of accountability. Throughout his text, Washington will emphasize the humility, hard work and effort, and making the most out of what one has, as the proper modes for self-advancement.</p>
<h2 id=why-are-there-no-diamonds-in-west-virginia>Why are there no diamonds in West Virginia?</h2>
<p>Diamonds don’t exist naturally in West Virginia, yet one of the largest ever found was discovered accidentally in a horseshoe pit in Monroe County in 1928. The diamond is an uncut naturally formed dodecahedral crystal, with 12 natural facets, weighing 34.48 carats and has a white color with a bluish tinge.</p>
<h2 id=when-did-the-salt-industry-start-in-west-virginia>When did the salt industry start in West Virginia?</h2>
<p>While West Virginia may be known for resources like coal, the country once turned to this mountain state for a culinary staple: salt. Salt production started in this part of the Appalachian mountains in the late 1700s. It was an industry built on the backs of slaves, and one that proved destructive to the region’s environment.</p>
<h2 id=where-was-the-salt-field-in-west-virginia>Where was the salt field in West Virginia?</h2>
<p>The importance of the Kanawha Salines manufacturers plummeted when another West Virginia brine field was discovered in the 1850s. Three Kanawha saltmakers developed the West Columbia salt field in Mason County on the Ohio River. Soon furnaces emerged at Hartford City, Mason City, and across the river around Pomeroy, Ohio.</p>
<h2 id=where-does-the-salt-come-from-in-virginia>Where does the salt come from in Virginia?</h2>
<p>Virginia has plenty of salt on its eastern edge, in solution with seawater of the Atlantic Ocean. The state also has buried deposits of salt on its western edge, remnants of the Sauk sea that filled the Central Appalachian Basin 350 million years ago.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-first-industry-in-west-virginia>What was the first industry in West Virginia?</h2>
<p>Birth of the Industry. The West Virginia coal industry dates to the western Virginia frontier of the early 1800s. The region’s first industry was salt, an essential mineral for preserving and shipping meat before refrigeration. Salt was produced by boiling brine, found abundantly along the banks of the Kanawha River.</p>
