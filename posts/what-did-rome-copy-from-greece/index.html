<h2 id=what-did-rome-copy-from-greece>What did Rome copy from Greece?</h2>
<p>For example, the Romans adopted the Greek pantheon of Gods and Godesses but changed their names—the Greek god of war was Ares, whereas the Roman god of war was Mars. The ancient Romans also copied ancient Greek art.</p>
<h2 id=which-country-is-closest-to-greece>Which country is closest to Greece?</h2>
<p>About Greece Greece is bordered by Albania, Bulgaria, Turkey, Republic of Macedonia, and it shares maritime borders with Cyprus, Egypt, Italy, and Libya.</p>
<h2 id=what-did-rome-think-of-greece>What did Rome think of Greece?</h2>
<p>The Romans thought that the Greeks were like children and were constantly quarreling – always keeping themselves disunified and being devious liars. They felt that the Greeks lacked order and were in need of the firm hand of a Pater Familias, to quote Rubicon (great book by the way).</p>
<h2 id=did-the-romans-just-copy-greece>Did the Romans just copy Greece?</h2>
<p>The ancient Romans did not “take” or “steal” or “copy” the Greek deities; they syncretized their own deities with the Greek ones and, in some cases, adopted Greek deities into their own pantheon. This was not plagiarism in any sense, but rather simply the way religion in the ancient world worked.</p>
<h2 id=how-are-greece-and-rome-similar-and-different>How are Greece and Rome similar and different?</h2>
<p>Both Greece and Rome are Mediterranean countries, similar enough latitudinally for both to grow wine and olives. However, their terrains were quite different. The ancient Greek city-stateswere separated from each other by hilly countryside and all were near the water.</p>
<h2 id=where-is-greece-located-in-relation-to-rome>Where is Greece located in relation to Rome?</h2>
<p>Greece is the modern country that is located in Eastern Europe boarding the Middle East to the eastern side and the Mediterranean Sea to the south. It is an ancient country that has existed for many decades, and it was at the center stage of the Roman Empire with the two cities exhibiting significant military battles.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-advantage-of-greece-over-rome>What was the advantage of Greece over Rome?</h2>
<p>An advantage Greece has over Rome was that the Greeks were very good sailors and traders because water was nearby. In conclusion, the geography of Greece and Rome effected the people around them and the resources they had available.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-the-romans-and-the-greeks-influence-each-other>How did the Romans and the Greeks influence each other?</h2>
<p>As civilization grew from one area to another, the Romans incorporated some cultural beliefs from the Greeks. It is worth noting that the two countries have continued to influence one another even in the modern era and it is difficult for one to distinguish between the cultures of the two countries.</p>
