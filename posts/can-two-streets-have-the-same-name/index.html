<h2 id=can-two-streets-have-the-same-name>Can two streets have the same name?</h2>
<p>Just about anything is possible in street naming. You can get duplicate streets, streets that are unique because of the direction they travel (e.g. lots of streets in Washington DC), numbers for the same street that reset when you cross into different areas.</p>
<h2 id=why-do-so-many-streets-have-the-same-name>Why do so many streets have the same name?</h2>
<p>It is because Main Street is often followed by Second Street and there is no First Street in the town. We used to test database systems by getting them to tell us the names of all the cities in the US which had an “Oak Street”.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-most-common-name-for-a-street>What is the most common name for a street?</h2>
<p>Most Common U.S. Street Names</p>
<ul>
<li>Cedar (5,644)</li>
<li>Eighth (5,524)</li>
<li>Elm (5,233)</li>
<li>View (5,202)</li>
<li>Washington (4,974)</li>
<li>Ninth (4,908)</li>
<li>Lake (4,901)</li>
<li>Hill (4,877)</li>
</ul>
<h2 id=do-all-streets-have-names>Do all streets have names?</h2>
<p>Streets, avenues, and roads aren’t named at random — many use a series of conventions that, once you recognize them, becomes impossible not to see. Though some of these rules have been muddied over time, if you tour your neighborhood you may find these names are a surprisingly effective way to decode our roads.</p>
<h2 id=whats-the-busiest-street-in-the-world>What’s the busiest street in the world?</h2>
<p>Nanjing Road is the main shopping street of Shanghai and is reputedly one of the world’s busiest shopping streets. It reminded us very much of Oxford Street in London with designer label shops.</p>
<h2 id=how-do-street-names-work>How do street names work?</h2>
<p>There’s no universal way American street names work, but in many cities, you have a grid pattern of numbered “streets” going north-south and numbered “avenues” going east-west or vice versa. In Washington, D.C., you have a grid pattern numbered streets going north-south and lettered streets going east-west.</p>
<h2 id=how-do-you-get-a-street-name-after-you>How do you get a street name after you?</h2>
<p>Here’s criteria for naming a street after someone</p>
<ol>
<li>Individuals must have provided “extraordinary public service or some exemplary contribution” to the public and be associated with the community where the highway is located.</li>
<li>The designee must be deceased or an elected official who is no longer in office.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id=what-city-has-the-busiest-traffic>What city has the busiest traffic?</h2>
<p>The top five areas and hours were:</p>
<ul>
<li>New York-Newark , 56.</li>
<li>Boston, 50.</li>
<li>Houston, 49.</li>
<li>Los Angeles-Long Beach-Anaheim, 46.</li>
<li>San Francisco-Oakland, 46.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id=are-there-any-streets-with-the-same-number>Are there any streets with the same number?</h2>
<p>The numbers 1 – 200 have been used @ both ends of the road so despite being in different suburbs & therefore having different Zip codes, there are multiple locations on the same street with the same number. Here is an example. There are at least 4 streets with this name SE 258TH STREET in the small town of COVINGTON in WASHINGTON state.</p>
<h2 id=how-are-streets-named-in-the-united-states>How are streets named in the United States?</h2>
<p>How Do Streets Get Named? For the most part, real estate and subdivision developers have the privilege of naming new streets in the United States.</p>
<h2 id=how-many-streets-have-been-named-after-martin-luther-king>How many streets have been named after Martin Luther King?</h2>
<p>King’s home state of Georgia had the most, with 75 streets as of 2001; this had increased to 105 as of 2006. As of 2003, there were over 600 American cities that had named a street after King. By 2004, this number had grown to 650, according to NPR.</p>
<h2 id=how-does-the-council-come-up-with-street-names>How does the Council come up with street names?</h2>
<p>They also name new roads and streets. The council involves the land developer in the street naming process. They invite suggestions and possible alternative names from the developer. These street names with postal numbers go before council for approval. Councils don’t allocate house names.</p>
