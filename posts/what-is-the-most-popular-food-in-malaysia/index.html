<h2 id=is-malaysian-food-spicy>Is Malaysian food spicy?</h2>
<p>Malay cooking is aromatic, strong and tends to be spicy. Malay cuisine utilizes many of the herbs and spices found throughout South East Asia. Most of the food you’ll find, like a popular Malay dish called Gulai (thick coconut gravy), will be cooked with chilies so therefore it will be spicy.</p>
<h2 id=is-it-ok-to-wear-shorts-in-kuala-lumpur>Is it OK to wear shorts in Kuala Lumpur?</h2>
<p>While it is preferable to wear pants in Kuala Lumpur, it is fine to wear skirts and shorts. Just don’t wear “short shorts” or mini skirts. Mid-thigh shorts and skirts are generally sufficient. There are some temples and even restaurants that will not allow you in if you’re not dressed conservatively.</p>
<h2 id=why-do-malaysians-not-eat-pork>Why do Malaysians not eat pork?</h2>
<p>Malaysia’s Chinese are mostly Buddhists or Christians and can eat pork. The Sedition Act punishes any “act” or “words” that cause “hatred or contempt” or “disaffection” against the government, the justice system, any “rulers” or “between different races or classes.”</p>
<h2 id=is-christianity-legal-in-malaysia>Is Christianity legal in Malaysia?</h2>
<p>Churches are allowed in Malaysia, though there are restrictions on construction of new churches through discriminatory zoning laws. No pre-existing churches have been closed down by the government and no standing congregations have been disbanded.</p>
<h2 id=do-you-get-pork-in-malaysia>Do you get pork in Malaysia?</h2>
<p>Beef can be commonly found cooked in curries, stews, roasted, or eaten with noodles. Malays generally eat beef that is halal. Malaysian Malays, who form about half of Malaysia’s population, are Muslim and therefore do not consume pork since Islam forbids it.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-daily-food-that-malaysian-people-eat>What is the daily food that Malaysian people eat?</h2>
<p>There are many Malay families that have untypical food items at home – such as pasta and other ‘western’ food, briyani, nasi minyak/tomato/kerabu/etc, noodles, etc. – but these are occasional fares, of course) What do Malaysians eat in a typical day?</p>
<h2 id=what-kind-of-rice-do-they-eat-in-malaysia>What kind of rice do they eat in Malaysia?</h2>
<p>Some call nasi lemak Malaysia’s unofficial national dish. Everyone else calls it delicious. Nasi lemak is basically rice cooked in coconut milk. It’s the sides that matter.</p>

<h2 id=do-you-have-to-eat-malaysian-food-to-be-gastronome>Do you have to eat Malaysian food to be gastronome?</h2>
<p>“Eating (and loving) Malaysian food should be a prerequisite for anyone proclaiming to be a gastronome. The holy amalgamations of Malaysian flavors are strengthened, not only by fierce spices, but by a group of people that are intensely passionate about their cuisine.</p>
