<h2 id=what-are-the-three-main-types-of-volcanoes>What are the three main types of volcanoes?</h2>
<p>The three main types of volcanoes are: stratovolcano (or composite volcano) — a conical volcano consisting of layers of solid lava flows mixed with layers of other rock. cinder cone volcano — doesn’t have any horizontal layers, and is instead a steep conical hill of tephra (volcanic debris) that accumulates around and downwind from the vent.</p>
<h2 id=whats-the-difference-between-cinder-cone-and-stratovolcano-volcanoes>What’s the difference between cinder cone and stratovolcano volcanoes?</h2>
<p>stratovolcano (or composite volcano) — a conical volcano consisting of layers of solid lava flows mixed with layers of other rock. cinder cone volcano — doesn’t have any horizontal layers, and is instead a steep conical hill of tephra (volcanic debris) that accumulates around and downwind from the vent.</p>
<h2 id=what-kind-of-lava-does-a-shield-volcano-produce>What kind of lava does a shield volcano produce?</h2>
<p>Shield volcanoes tend to erupt fluid basalt lava. Violent explosions are possible. But they’re not as common for shield volcanoes. Because basalt has a low viscosity (more watery), it can flow on the surface better. When these types of volcanoes erupt, lava flows out large distances.</p>
<h2 id=what-kind-of-volcanoes-are-found-in-hawaii>What kind of volcanoes are found in Hawaii?</h2>
<p>Hawaiian volcanoes are quintessential shield volcanoes. If you go to Hawaii, they are broad and flat. These volcanoes can be hundreds of kilometers wide. Shield volcanoes tend to erupt fluid basalt lava.</p>

<h2 id=are-there-any-volcanoes-in-the-united-states>Are there any volcanoes in the United States?</h2>
<p>The vast majority of states do not have active volcanoes. There are active volcanoes in California, Oregon, Washington, Hawaii, and Wyoming. Other states do not have active volcanoes. Are there volcanoes in the united states? Yes, there’s dozen of volcanoes all across the United States. Three different types of volcanoes?</p>
<h2 id=how-did-the-three-sisters-volcano-get-there-name>How did the Three Sisters volcano get there name?</h2>
<p>The Three Sisters join several other volcanoes in the eastern segment of the Cascade Range known as the High Cascades, which trends north–south. Constructed towards the end of the Pleistocene Epoch, these mountains are underlain by more ancient volcanoes that subsided due to parallel north–south faulting in the surrounding region.</p>

<h2 id=which-is-the-best-description-of-a-composite-volcano>Which is the best description of a composite volcano?</h2>
<p>Composite volcanoes. Some of the Earth’s grandest mountains are composite volcanoes–sometimes called stratovolcanoes. They are typically steep-sided, symmetrical cones of large dimension built of alternating layers of lava flows, volcanic ash, cinders, blocks, and bombs and may rise as much as 8,000 feet above their bases.</p>
<h2 id=what-kind-of-structure-does-a-shield-volcano-have>What kind of structure does a shield volcano have?</h2>
<p>The internal structure of a typical shield volcano Shield volcanoes, the third type of volcano, are built almost entirely of fluid lava flows. Flow after flow pours out in all directions from a central summit vent, or group of vents, building a broad, gently sloping cone of flat, domical shape, with a profile much like that of a warrior’s shield.</p>

<p>There are three main types of volcano – composite or strato, shield and dome. Composite volcanoes, sometimes known as strato volcanoes, are steep sided cones formed from layers of ash and [lava] flows.</p>
<h2 id=how-are-composite-volcanoes-different-from-regular-volcanoes>How are composite volcanoes different from regular volcanoes?</h2>
<p>Composite volcanoes are made of cinders, ash, and lava. Cinders and ash pile on top of each other, lava flows on top of the ash, where it cools and hardens, and then the process repeats. Shield volcanoes are volcanoes shaped like a bowl or shield in the middle with long gentle slopes made by basaltic lava flows.</p>
<h2 id=why-are-there-so-many-volcanoes-around-the-world>Why are there so many volcanoes around the world?</h2>
<p>There are many volcanos all around the world, some are deemed dormant while others are active. The movement of earth’s plates create all sorts of volcanos. The oceanic crust and continental crust are responsible for earthquakes which can even cause eruption.</p>
<h2 id=how-are-shield-volcanoes-different-from-other-volcanoes>How are shield volcanoes different from other volcanoes?</h2>
<p>Shield volcanoes are typically large mafic volcanoes that have wide broad and low relief slopes. The lava erupted from a shield volcano is typically runny and low in gas so the lava simply flows down the side of the volcano during an eruption. Think of lava you’ve seen flowing off the edge of the big island of Hawaii and into the ocean.</p>

<h2 id=which-is-the-most-active-volcano-in-the-world>Which is the most active volcano in the world?</h2>
<p>Mount Kilauea, The World’s most active volcano is a shiled volcano. What are the different types of volcano? What are the three main volcanoes? What are the three main volcanoes? There are three main types of volcano – composite or strato, shield and dome.</p>
<h2 id=which-is-the-most-circular-shape-of-a-volcano>Which is the most circular shape of a volcano?</h2>
<p>Cinder cones look the most circular, and the lava flows from a single vent. Shield volcanoes look like shields and are made from a special kind of lava called basalt lava. What determines a volcanoes shape?</p>
<h2 id=which-is-an-example-of-a-composite-volcano>Which is an example of a composite volcano?</h2>
<p>Examples of composite volcanoes include Mount Fuji (Japan), Mount St Helens (USA) and Mount Pinatubo (Philippines). Shield volcanoes are low with gently sloping sides and are formed from layers of lava. Eruptions are typically non-explosive. Shield volcanoes produce fast flowing fluid [lava] that can flow for many miles.</p>
<h2 id=what-kind-of-volcano-has-ash-and-lava>What kind of volcano has ash and lava?</h2>
<p>When most people think about a volcano, they just imagine a conical mountain with ash and/or lava going out from its mouth. But that’s just one type of volcano – the stratovolcano (or composite volcano). The eruptions from these volcanoes may be a pyroclastic flow rather than a lava flow.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-the-types-of-volcanoes-in-california>What are the types of volcanoes in California?</h2>
<p>One interesting one is “Mammoth Mountain,” which explores Hot Creek and the volcanic area it is a part of in California. Composite, shield, cinder cones, and supervolcanoes are the main types of volcanoes. Composite volcanoes are tall, steep cones that produce explosive eruptions.</p>

<p>Figure 11.22 Comparison of volcano sizes and shapes. Broad, rounded shield volcanoes are the largest, followed by cone-shaped composite volcanoes. Straight-sided cinder cones are the smallest, and barely visible in the scale of the diagram.</p>
<p>Stratovolcano (Composite Volcano) A stratovolcano, sometimes referred to as a composite volcano, is an explosive volcano that has built up several layers through continuous eruptions. The volcano is typically conical and large in scale compared to cinder cone volcanoes.</p>
