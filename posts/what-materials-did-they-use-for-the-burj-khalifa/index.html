<h2 id=what-materials-did-they-use-for-the-burj-khalifa>What materials did they use for the Burj Khalifa?</h2>
<p>Construction Highlights Burj Khalifa’s construction will have used 330,000 m3 (431,600 cu yd) of concrete and 39,000 tonnes (43,000 ST; 38,000 LT) of steel rebar, and construction will have taken 22 million man-hours. The exterior cladding of Burj Khalifa began in May 2007 and was completed in September 2009.</p>
<h2 id=is-burj-khalifa-made-of-concrete>Is Burj Khalifa made of concrete?</h2>
<p>Burj Khalifa employs a record-breaking 330,000 cubic m (11.6 million cubic ft) of concrete; 39,000 m/t of reinforced steel; 103,000 sq m (1.1 million sq ft) of glass; 15,500 sq m (166,800 sq ft) of embossed stainless steel; and the tower took 22 million man hours to build.</p>
<h2 id=which-cement-is-used-for-making-burj-khalifa>Which cement is used for making Burj Khalifa?</h2>
<p>Elkem Microsilica® is used to make the high strength concrete that is essential for constructing the world’s tallest buildings, such as the record breaking Burj Khalifa in Dubai. In this application, Elkem Microsilica® is used as a cost effective means to increase the compressive strength of the concrete mix.</p>
<h2 id=why-is-the-burj-khalifa-made-out-of-concrete>Why is the Burj Khalifa made out of concrete?</h2>
<p>Its reinforced concrete structure makes it stronger than steel-frame skyscrapers. Also See: GeoTechnical Engineering. Designers purposely shaped the structural concrete Burj Dubai – “Y” shaped in plan – to reduce the wind forces on the tower, as well as to keep the structure simple and foster constructibility.</p>
<h2 id=why-was-burj-al-arab-built-in-dubai>Why was Burj al Arab built in Dubai?</h2>
<p>Burj Al-Arab Project was conceived as a response to the looming end of oil era in Dubai by the then Crown Prince Sheik Mohammed in 1990. He was determined to position Dubai as World’s most exclusive luxury holiday destination and playground for the rich by diversification of Dubai’s economy through tourism and real estate.</p>
<h2 id=what-kind-of-expressionism-is-in-the-burj-al-arab>What kind of Expressionism is in the Burj al Arab?</h2>
<p>●Burj al Arab has the structural expressionism. ●Structural Expressionism basically means that the structural components of the building are visible on the inside as well as outside. ●This includes features such as exposed truss work and complex shapes. BURJ AL-ARAB</p>
<h2 id=how-did-the-burj-khalifa-get-its-name>How did the Burj Khalifa get its name?</h2>
<p>It was renamed in honour of the ruler of Abu Dhabi, Khalifa bin Zayed Al Nahyan; Abu Dhabi and the federal government of UAE lent Dubai tens of billions of US dollars so that Dubai could pay its debts – Dubai borrowed at least $80 billion for construction projects.</p>
