<p>The conflict led Red Cloud on a journey to Washington, D.C., to meet with President Ulysses S. Grant (1822–1885; served 1869–77; see entry) to negotiate for trading rights at Fort Laramie. While trading rights were granted, settlers continued to pour into the region and railroad lines were being constructed to bring more settlers to the frontier.</p>

<h2 id=where-was-the-red-cloud-indian-reservation-located>Where was the Red Cloud Indian Reservation located?</h2>
<p>The following year it was removed to the forks of the White River, in present-day South Dakota, where it was renamed the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation .

<h2 id=when-did-red-cloud-meet-with-president-grant>When did Red Cloud meet with President Grant?</h2>
<p>Red Cloud again traveled to Washington, D.C., and met with President Grant in 1875. Unwilling to try to force settlers to stop moving into the area, Grant offered $25,000 to the Sioux if they would give up their rights to hunt along the Platte River in Dakota Territory.</p>
