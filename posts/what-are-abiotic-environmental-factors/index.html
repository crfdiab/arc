<h2 id=what-are-abiotic-environmental-factors>What are abiotic environmental factors?</h2>
<p>An abiotic factor is a non-living part of an ecosystem that shapes its environment. In a terrestrial ecosystem, examples might include temperature, light, and water. In a marine ecosystem, abiotic factors would include salinity and ocean currents. Abiotic and biotic factors work together to create a unique ecosystem.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-the-difference-between-biotic-and-abiotic-environment>What are the difference between biotic and abiotic environment?</h2>
<p>Abiotic factors refer to non-living physical and chemical elements in the ecosystem. Biotic describes a living component of an ecosystem; for example organisms, such as plants and animals. Examples Water, light, wind, soil, humidity, minerals, gases.</p>
<h2 id=how-are-abiotic-components-related-to-living-things>How are abiotic components related to living things?</h2>
<p>Abiotic components or abiotic factors are nonliving factors that impact an ecosystem. These factors are part of the ecosystem and influence the associated living things but they are not living. The term abiotic is a mix of two words, these are a- which means without and bio which means life. What are the Types of Abiotic Components?</p>
<h2 id=how-are-biotic-and-climatic-factors-related-to-living-organisms>How are biotic and climatic factors related to living organisms?</h2>
<p>Biotic Factors. The former two factors are abiotic components that contain matter and energy. All living organisms, including human beings live in some sort of abiotic component of environment, that contains matter and energy. Various environmental factors can be divided into following two groups: 1. Climatic factors 2. Edaphic factors 3.</p>
<h2 id=how-are-biotic-factors-related-to-edaphic-factors>How are biotic factors related to edaphic factors?</h2>
<p>Edaphic factors 3. Biotic Factors. The former two factors are abiotic components that contain matter and energy. These are related to the aerial environment of the organisms e.g. light, precipitation, temperature, atmospheric humidity, wind, etc.</p>
