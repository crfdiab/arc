<h2 id=what-were-the-reasons-australia-went-to-war>What were the reasons Australia went to war?</h2>
<p>They felt as if they owed Britain loyalty. To them, Britain was still the ‘mother country’. Many Australians, at the start of the war, were enthusiastic about Australia going to war to support Britain. This was the first reason Australia decided to go to war with Britain in WWI.</p>
<h2 id=has-there-ever-been-a-war-in-australia>Has there ever been a war in Australia?</h2>
<p>Over 100,000 Australians have lost their lives through war. Australia’s history is different from that of many other nations in that since the first coming of the Europeans and their dispossession of the Aboriginals, Australia has not experienced a subsequent invasion; no war has since been fought on Australian soil.</p>
<h2 id=how-long-has-australia-been-at-war>How long has Australia been at war?</h2>
<p>Australia so often at war In the 78 years since the outbreak of the Second World War, we have been at war somewhere in the world for 60 years. We have been at war continually since 2001, and there is no end in sight to our involvement in the Middle East.</p>
<h2 id=when-did-world-war-3-end>When did World War 3 end?</h2>
<p>November 2, 2032<br>
World War III (often abbreviated to WWIII or WW3), also known as the Third World War or the ACMF/NATO War, was a global war that lasted from October 28, 2026, to November 2, 2032. A majority of nations, including most of the world’s great powers, fought on two sides consisting of military alliances.</p>
<h2 id=why-did-australia-become-involved-in-world-war-1>Why did Australia become involved in World War 1?</h2>
<p>Why Australia became involved in WW1 They became involved in august 1914 because Britain was preparing to declare war on Germany. Australia became involved in WW1 for a lot of reasons. The first reason that they were involved in the first war is because of Australia’s mother country (Britain).</p>
<h2 id=why-is-australia-going-to-war-with-china>Why is Australia going to war with China?</h2>
<p>The idea of Australia fighting a war against China on its own is ridiculous. Last year, Australia’s military spending was about $27 billion, according to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute. China’s was estimated to be 10 times higher, for the same period, at about $252 billion, the second highest in the world.</p>
<h2 id=what-kind-of-military-history-does-australia-have>What kind of military history does Australia have?</h2>
<p>Although this history is short when compared to that of many other nations, Australia has been involved in numerous conflicts and wars, and war and military service have been significant influences on Australian society and national identity, including the Anzac spirit.</p>
<h2 id=why-was-the-emu-war-of-australia-important>Why was the Emu War of Australia important?</h2>
<p>It was an attempt to curb the number of emus that were running amok and damaging crops in the Campion district of western Australia. The ‘ war ’ was unsuccessful in bringing down the emu population, which is why it’s considered a rare war where humans were defeated.</p>
