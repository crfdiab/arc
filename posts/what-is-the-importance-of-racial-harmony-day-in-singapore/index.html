<h2 id=what-is-the-importance-of-racial-harmony-day-in-singapore>What is the importance of racial harmony day in Singapore?</h2>
<p>SINGAPORE – Racial Harmony Day is not just another event on the school calendar, but a reminder that Singapore’s diversity is a strength, and harmony must continue to be instilled and built up, Singapore’s top leaders said on Wednesday (July 21).</p>
<h2 id=why-must-we-celebrate-racial-harmony-day>Why must we celebrate Racial Harmony Day?</h2>
<p>History. First launched in 1997 by the Ministry of Education in schools, the event commemorates the 1964 race riots which took place during turbulent times on 21 July 1964 when Singapore was still a part of Malaysia as a state (1963–1965), in which 22 people lost their lives and hundreds were severely injured.</p>
<h2 id=why-is-racial-and-religious-harmony-important-in-singapore>Why is racial and religious harmony important in Singapore?</h2>
<p>Singapore is a multi-racial and multi-religious society. Therefore, racial and religious harmony is vital for Singapore’s social cohesion. This harmony does not come naturally – we need to take the effort to build trust, and acceptance between different races and religions, and protect the common space that we have.</p>
<h2 id=why-is-it-important-to-have-racial-harmony>Why is it important to have racial harmony?</h2>
<p>Almost everyone agreed that racial harmony is important – and this is especially critical today where we witness racial prejudice happening around the world. More importantly, we must strive to better understand our various cultures and practices to form strong friendships across communities.</p>
<h2 id=how-does-the-mha-maintain-religious-harmony-in-singapore>How does the MHA maintain religious harmony in Singapore?</h2>
<p>The Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) takes a strong stance against threats to Singapore’s race and religious harmony. Legislation, such as the Maintenance of Religious Harmony Act, introduce powers that would allow pre-emptive action to be taken to maintain religious harmony in Singapore.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-the-five-principles-of-singapore-harmony>What are the five principles of Singapore harmony?</h2>
<p>Since Independence, Singapore has relied on five principles to guide its people on a path towards communal harmony: keep race and religion out of politics, ensure multiracialism, have a unifying language and secular education, offer equal opportunities for all, and everyone is equal before the law.
