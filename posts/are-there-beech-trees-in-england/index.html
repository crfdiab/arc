<h2 id=are-there-beech-trees-in-england>Are there beech trees in England?</h2>
<p>In the UK, common beech is only considered truly native to south-east England and south-east Wales. Beech is known as the queen of British trees.</p>
<h2 id=why-are-beech-trees-dying-uk>Why are beech trees dying UK?</h2>
<p>Plant ecologist Prof Jump said: “Beech trees across Europe are extremely vulnerable to the effects of drought. These long dry spells cause sudden and widespread reduced growth within the species. “We might expect beech forests in hotter and drier regions of Europe, such as southern France and Spain, to be most at risk.</p>
<h2 id=how-old-do-beech-trees-live-uk>How old do beech trees live UK?</h2>
<p>Beech trees can develop into giants which tower over all other woodland trees and can live to 300 years.</p>
<h2 id=where-are-beech-trees-most-common>Where are beech trees most common?</h2>
<p>The beech most commonly grown as an ornamental tree is the European beech (Fagus sylvatica), widely cultivated in North America and its native Europe. Many varieties are in cultivation, notably the weeping beech F. sylvatica ‘Pendula’, several varieties of copper or purple beech, the fern-leaved beech F.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-killing-beech-trees>What is killing beech trees?</h2>
<p>Why we care: Beech bark disease (BBD) is caused by both a sap-feeding scale insect and a fungus. American beech trees are first infested with beech scale. Scale feeding allows infection by the Neonectria fungus. The fungus kills the wood, blocking the flow of sap.</p>
<h2 id=can-you-keep-a-beech-tree-small>Can you keep a beech tree small?</h2>
<p>Any tree can be kept small. The tricolor beech behind Janet was just the size we wanted it to be 16 years before this photo was taken. It’s still that size because we prune it every two years in August. We use techniques that have worked well for at least a thousand years for gardeners in tight places.</p>
<h2 id=are-beech-trees-bad>Are beech trees bad?</h2>
<p>That’s bad news, both because beeches spread at the expense of other species, including sugar maples, red maples, and birches, and because beeches are highly susceptible to a bark disease that stunts their development and makes them commercially useless.</p>
<h2 id=are-beech-trees-dying>Are beech trees dying?</h2>
<p>In the United States, however, healthy beech trees have been observed dying in a period of six years from the onset of symptoms. As BLD progressively worsens, the tree’s overall health weakens exposing it to secondary insect pests and diseases.</p>
<h2 id=why-are-beech-trees-dying>Why are beech trees dying?</h2>
<p>As BBD spreads through the forest, beech trees will begin to die. The dead and dying trees often suffer from a condition called beech snap, where part of the beech tree will snap off and fall to the ground, espe- cially in high wind events.</p>
<h2 id=can-beech-trees-be-pollarded>Can beech trees be pollarded?</h2>
<p>Pollarding can be used on many trees including the following: ash, lime, elm, oak, beech, poplar, eldar, london plane, fruit trees, eucalyptus and sweet chestnut. Trees may be pollarded as soon as they have reached the desired height and the form can then be chosen.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-a-beech-tree-good-for>What is a beech tree good for?</h2>
<p>A very hard and straight-grained wood, beech is often used in the making of furniture, cabinetry, cooking utensils, tool handles, plywood and sports equipment. Even musical instruments: used for piano pin-blocks and drum manufacturing, beech holds a tone between maple and birch.</p>
<h2 id=where-are-common-beech-trees-found-in-the-uk>Where are common beech trees found in the UK?</h2>
<p>Here are our tips on how to spot them, why some may look a little different and other interesting facts about this fantastic species. The common beech ( Fagus sylvatica), is an unusual tree in the UK, as it’s considered native only to the South East of England. But it is commonly planted throughout the UK. Look out for:</p>
<h2 id=how-old-is-the-average-age-of-a-beech-tree>How old is the average age of a beech tree?</h2>
<p>Typically a veteran beech will be 125-200 years of age and a notable beech may be 75-150 years old. Beech can grow up to 6m plus in girth. Record all beech more than 4m. Consider recording all beech with any ancient characteristics more than 3m.</p>
<h2 id=why-are-beech-trees-known-as-queen-of-british-trees>Why are beech trees known as Queen of British trees?</h2>
<p>Beech woodland is shady and characterised by a dense carpet of fallen leaves and mast husks which prevent most woodland plants from growing. Only specialist shade-tolerant plants can survive beneath a beech canopy. Beech is known as the queen of British trees. Did you know?</p>
<h2 id=what-kind-of-animals-live-in-beech-trees>What kind of animals live in beech trees?</h2>
<p>Beech woodland provides an important habitat for many butterflies, particularly in open glades and along woodland rides. Beech foliage is eaten by the caterpillars of moths, including the barred hook-tip, clay triple-lines and olive crescent. The seeds are eaten by mice, voles, squirrels and birds. Native truffle fungi grow in beech woods.</p>
