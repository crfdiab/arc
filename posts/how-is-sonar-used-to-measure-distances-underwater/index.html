<h2 id=how-is-sonar-used-to-measure-distances-underwater>How is sonar used to measure distances underwater?</h2>
<p>Ships using technology called sonar, which stands for sound navigation and ranging, can map the topography of the ocean floor. The device sends sound waves to the bottom of the ocean and measures how long it takes for an echo to return.</p>
<h2 id=how-does-the-sonar-measure-distance>How does the sonar measure distance?</h2>
<p>In simplest form, a sonar sends out sound waves. These reflect off a target and the sonar records the echo. By calculating the time it takes for the sound wave to travel to its target and bounce back, a distance between the sonar and the target is established.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-sonar-system-of-measurement>What is sonar system of measurement?</h2>
<p>Sonar (sound navigation and ranging) is a technology that uses acoustical waves to sense the location of objects in the ocean. The simplest sonar devices send out a sound pulse from a transducer, and then precisely measure the time it takes for the sound pulses to be reflected back to the transducer.</p>
<h2 id=how-does-sonar-work-underwater>How does sonar work underwater?</h2>
<p>Active sonar transducers emit an acoustic signal or pulse of sound into the water. If an object is in the path of the sound pulse, the sound bounces off the object and returns an “echo” to the sonar transducer. If the transducer is equipped with the ability to receive signals, it measures the strength of the signal.</p>
<h2 id=how-does-sonar-measure-speed>How does sonar measure speed?</h2>
<p>This is important for submarines, because if they emit a wave of a known frequency, and it bounces back with a different frequency they can calculate the speed of that object. This form of the equation refers to the target’s motion being toward that of the submarine. …</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-basic-principle-on-which-sonar-works>What is the basic principle on which SONAR works?</h2>
<p>reflection of sound waves<br>
So we can conclude that SONAR works on the principle of reflection of sound waves.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-sonar-explain-with-diagram>What is SONAR explain with diagram?</h2>
<p>SONAR (Sound navigation and ranging) is a method used in submarines and ships to detect far away objects and obstacles in water. It is based on the principle of reflection of ultrasound waves. It has various applications like echo depth sounding (to find the depth of the sea), detecting enemy submarine etc.</p>
<h2 id=which-is-the-best-description-of-the-use-of-sonar>Which is the best description of the use of sonar?</h2>
<p>For other uses, see Sonar (disambiguation). Sonar ( so und na vigation r anging) is a technique that uses sound propagation (usually underwater, as in submarine navigation) to navigate, communicate with or detect objects on or under the surface of the water, such as other vessels.</p>
<h2 id=what-kind-of-transponder-does-a-sonar-system-use>What kind of transponder does a sonar system use?</h2>
<p>Modern active sonar systems use an acoustic transponder to generate a sound wave which is reflected back from target objects.</p>
<h2 id=how-are-passive-sonar-arrays-used-on-submarines>How are passive sonar arrays used on submarines?</h2>
<p>Passive sonar arrays for submarines were developed from ADP crystals. Several crystal assemblies were arranged in a steel tube, vacuum-filled with castor oil, and sealed. The tubes then were mounted in parallel arrays.</p>
<h2 id=where-was-the-first-submarine-sonar-system-built>Where was the first submarine sonar system built?</h2>
<p>The Canadian engineer Reginald Fessenden, while working for the Submarine Signal Company in Boston, Massachusetts, built an experimental system beginning in 1912, a system later tested in Boston Harbor, and finally in 1914 from the U.S. Revenue Cutter Miami on the Grand Banks off Newfoundland.</p>
