<h2 id=is-westminster-abbey-worth-visiting>Is Westminster Abbey worth visiting?</h2>
<p>Famous the world over, Westminster Abbey has seen over 16 royal weddings, including Will and Kate’s, and is the burial location of 17 monarchs. One of the jewels in London’s crown, Westminster Abbey is a must-visit for history lovers and those who enjoy a touch of royalty!</p>
<h2 id=does-westminster-abbey-have-a-dress-code>Does Westminster Abbey have a dress code?</h2>
<p>The dress code is NO low cut or sleeveless clothing, shorts, miniskirts, and no hats in the church. No pets are allowed on the premises – and this includes dogs walking the grounds.</p>
<h2 id=what-building-is-next-to-westminster-abbey>What building is next to Westminster Abbey?</h2>
<p>the Jewel Tower<br>
Going south from St Margaret’s and immediately next door is the Jewel Tower. The Jewel Tower is a surviving part of Westminster Palace from the fire in 1834. The tower was built to house the King’s wardrobe and jewels in 1365.</p>
<h2 id=can-you-wear-shorts-in-westminster-abbey>Can you wear shorts in Westminster Abbey?</h2>
<p>– Westminster Abbey.</p>
<h2 id=how-much-does-it-cost-to-enter-st-pauls-cathedral>How much does it cost to enter St Paul’s Cathedral?</h2>
<p>Paul’s Cathedral is open from Monday to Saturday between 8:30 a.m. and 4:30 p.m. (with last admission at 4:15 p.m.), and the recommended visiting time is approximately two hours. Tickets at the door cost £18 for adults, £16 for students and seniors, and £8 for children (ages six to 17).</p>
<h2 id=is-it-free-to-visit-st-pauls-cathedral>Is it free to visit St Paul’s Cathedral?</h2>
<p>While it is free to attend a service, to experience all of St. Paul’s glory, including its historic galleries, tombs, and domes, you must buy tickets. Included in your ticket are admission to St Paul’s, an introductory talk, an audio tour, a multimedia tour, and a guided tour (limited availability).</p>
<h2 id=are-there-toilets-at-westminster-abbey>Are there toilets at Westminster Abbey?</h2>
<p>We have toilet facilities onsite in the Cloisters and as part of our Cellarium cafe. Each facility also has accessible toilets and baby changing areas. Yes, inside are free toilets at the end of the visit. over a year ago.</p>
<h2 id=whats-the-best-way-to-see-westminster-abbey>What’s the best way to see Westminster Abbey?</h2>
<p>According to Tripadvisor travellers, these are the best ways to experience Westminster Abbey: Westminster Abbey and the Houses of Parliament Tour in London (From US$ 33.69) Westminster and Buckingham private walking tour (From US$ 29.30) Westminster Walking Tour & Westminster Abbey Entry (From US$ 69.41)</p>
<h2 id=do-you-start-at-buckingham-palace-or-westminster-abbey>Do you start at Buckingham Palace or Westminster Abbey?</h2>
<p>The walk is a circular walk, so it doesn’t matter really where you start. If you want to see Changing of the Guard at Buckingham Palace late morning it will probably be best advised to start the loop at Westminster Abbey.</p>
<h2 id=how-long-does-it-take-to-walk-london-without-stopping>How long does it take to walk London without stopping?</h2>
<p>If you walked this without stopping you’d do it in under an hour, but as there is so much to see you probably will have done well to complete it in one day. These notes have focus on the logistics, no attempt is made to be a substitute for a good guide book on London.</p>
<h2 id=how-long-does-it-take-to-walk-the-thames>How long does it take to walk the Thames?</h2>
<p>Which means that if you set off at 9am you will need until 3pm to walk 12 miles. That’s probably enough for one day. Unlike most long distance paths, the Thames Path passes by many attractions and you may want to consider planning some time to visit these.</p>
