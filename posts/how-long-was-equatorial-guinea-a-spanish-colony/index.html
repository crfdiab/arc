<h2 id=how-long-was-equatorial-guinea-a-spanish-colony>How long was Equatorial Guinea a Spanish colony?</h2>
<p>Between 1778 and 1810, Spain administered the territory of Equatorial Guinea via its colonial Viceroyalty of the Río de la Plata, based in Buenos Aires (in present-day Argentina).</p>
<h2 id=when-did-spain-take-over-equatorial-guinea>When did Spain take over Equatorial Guinea?</h2>
<p>Bata is the administrative capital of the mainland. Formerly a colony of Spain with the name Spanish Guinea, the country achieved its independence on October 12, 1968. The capital is Malabo, on Bioko. Equatorial Guinea Encyclopædia Britannica, Inc.</p>
<h2 id=when-did-equatorial-guinea-become-a-spanish-colony>When did Equatorial Guinea become a Spanish colony?</h2>
<p>When the Spanish Civil War broke out in 1820, rebel forces took control of the colony. The mainland of Equatorial Guinea became a Spanish colony in 1900. With increasing nationalist sentiment and escalating pressure from the United Nations (UN) General Assembly, the journey to independence was underway.</p>
<h2 id=what-did-spain-do-with-the-spanish-guinea>What did Spain do with the Spanish Guinea?</h2>
<p>Following the Spanish-American War (1898), Spanish Guinea remained as Spain’s last significant tropical colony. Profiting from the weakness of Spain, France was able to confine mainland Spanish Guinea to its present limited extent. Economic development started only at that time and was concentrated on the richer and healthier Fernando Po.</p>
<h2 id=when-did-portugal-gain-control-of-equatorial-guinea>When did Portugal gain control of Equatorial Guinea?</h2>
<p>On their way to India, Portuguese explorers discovered the island of Bioko, and later colonized the islands of Fernando Poo and Annobon. They retained control of Equatorial Guinea until 1778, when the territory was ceded to Spain in exchange for land in South America.</p>
<h2 id=where-was-the-last-spanish-colony-to-gain-independence>Where was the last Spanish colony to gain independence?</h2>
<p>In our geographic imaginaries, Spanish colonialism tends to be mapped onto South America and perhaps the Philippines. However, the last Spanish colony to claim independence from Spain in 1968 was a territory in West Africa—Equatorial Guinea—a nation-state where Spanish still serves as the official language.</p>
