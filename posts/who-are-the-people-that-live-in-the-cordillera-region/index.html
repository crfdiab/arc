<h2 id=who-are-the-people-that-live-in-the-cordillera-region>Who are the people that live in the Cordillera region?</h2>
<p>A big bulk of the Cordillera population is composed of closely-related indigenous peoples. Collectively, our peoples are popularly known as Igorot. Often we are also grouped into a number of ethnic or ethno-linguistic identities, such as Apayao or Isneg, Tinggian, Kalinga, Bontoc, Kankanaey, Ibaloy, Ifugao, and Bago.</p>
<h2 id=who-were-the-first-people-to-live-in-the-cordillera>Who were the first people to live in the Cordillera?</h2>
<p>In the northwest were the Athapaskan speaking peoples, Slavey, Tli Cho, Tutchone speaking peoples and Tlingit. Along the Pacific coast were the Haida, Salish, Kwakiutl, Nuu-chah-nulth, Nisga’a and Gitxsan. In the plains were the Blackfoot, Kainai, Sarcee and Northern Peigan.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-jobs-in-the-cordillera>What are jobs in the Cordillera?</h2>
<p>The natural resources of the Cordillera are forestry (this is the biggest industry in the region), agriculture, mining (iron, lead, zinc, silver, copper and nickel) and fisheries (the west coast is famous for salmon).</p>
<h2 id=what-does-cordillera-look-like>What does Cordillera look like?</h2>
<p>The Cordillera includes plateaus, valleys and plains as well as rugged mountains. The most continuous mountain chains, known as the Coast and Rocky Mountains, form high rims along the southwestern and southeastern sides of a belt of varied terrain.</p>
<h2 id=how-many-people-live-in-the-cordillera-region>How many people live in the Cordillera region?</h2>
<p>The Cordillera is more heavily populated compared to the other mountainous areas of the Philippines. Based on the year 2000 census, its six provinces and one city has a total population of more than 1,365,000 people.</p>
<h2 id=what-do-people-do-in-the-western-cordillera>What do people do in the Western Cordillera?</h2>
<p>These activities include: skiing/snowboarding, dogsledding, ice climbing, snowshoeing, snowmobiling and many more. Finally the Western Cordillera region is also known for having beautiful wildlife because of all of the mountains and forests that make up the provinces of the region.</p>
<h2 id=where-are-the-foothills-of-the-cordillera-mountains>Where are the foothills of the Cordillera Mountains?</h2>
<p>The bulk of the Cordillera mountain range, as a physical region, is covered by this Cordillera administrative region (CAR). The Cordillera’s foothills extend into a few other adjacent provinces in the nearby Ilocos and Cagayan Valley regions. The Cordillera region is very rich in natural resources.</p>
<h2 id=where-is-cordillera-administrative-region-in-the-philippines>Where is Cordillera Administrative Region in the Philippines?</h2>
<p>Cordillera Administrative Region ( CAR ), also known as Cordillera Region ( Ilocano: Rehion/Deppaar Administratibo ti Kordiliera; Tagalog: Rehiyong Pampangasiwaan ng Cordillera ), is an administrative region in the Philippines, situated within the island of Luzon.</p>
