<p>We know that a range of contributing factors can lead to clinical depression.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>genetics (family history)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>biochemical factors (brain chemistry)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>illness.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>personality style.</p>

<h2 id=stressful-or-traumatic-events-what-biological-factors-cause-depression>stressful or traumatic events. What biological factors cause depression?</h2>
<p>The biological factors that might have some effect on depression include: genes, hormones, and brain chemicals. Depression often runs in families, which suggests that individuals may inherit genes that make them vulnerable to developing depression.</p>
<h2 id=what-hormone-is-released-during-depression>What hormone is released during depression?</h2>
<p>Serotonin is in the brain. It is thought to regulate mood, happiness, and anxiety. Low levels of serotonin are linked to depression, while increased levels of the hormone may decrease arousal.</p>
<h2 id=who-is-at-higher-risk-of-depression>Who is at higher risk of depression?</h2>
<p>Age. Major depression is most likely to affect people between the ages of 45 and 65. “People in middle age are at the top of the bell curve for depression, but the people at each end of the curve, the very young and very old, may be at higher risk for severe depression,” says Walch.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-the-behavioral-and-biological-components-of-depression>What are the behavioral and biological components of depression?</h2>
<p>Depression has been linked to problems or imbalances in the brain, specifically with the neurotransmitters serotonin, norepinephrine, and dopamine. It is very difficult to actually measure the level of neurotransmitters in a person’s brain and their activity.</p>
<h2 id=how-does-depression-change-the-brain>How does depression change the brain?</h2>
<p>There’s growing evidence that several parts of the brain shrink in people with depression. Specifically, these areas lose gray matter volume (GMV). That’s tissue with a lot of brain cells. GMV loss seems to be higher in people who have regular or ongoing depression with serious symptoms.</p>
<h2 id=what-race-has-highest-rate-of-depression>What race has highest rate of depression?</h2>
<p>Persons ages 40–59 years had the highest prevalence of probable depression (9.2%) relative to persons ages 18–39 (7.6%) and ages ≥60 (6.7%). Non-Hispanic Black (9.8%) and Hispanic (9.2%) persons had higher prevalence of probable depression than non-Hispanic White persons (7.5%) or persons of Other race (7.2%).</p>
<h2 id=what-are-two-risk-factors-for-depression>What are two risk factors for depression?</h2>
<p>Risk Factors</p>
<ul>
<li>Genetics: A history of depression in your family may make it more likely for you to get it.</li>
<li>Death or loss: Sadness and grief are normal reactions.</li>
<li>Conflict: Personal turmoil or disputes with family or friends may lead to depression.</li>
<li>Abuse: Past physical, sexual, or emotional abuse can bring it on, as well.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id=what-are-some-lifestyle-factors-that-can-cause-depression>What are some lifestyle factors that can cause depression?</h2>
<p>Negative lifestyle factors that can contribute to a depressive episode or drag one out include: 1 Abusing drugs and alcohol 2 Overwork 3 Poor diet, including excess caffeine or sugar 4 Lack of exercise 5 Poor sleep 6 Lack of leisure time as well as fun and recreational activities</p>
<h2 id=what-are-the-genetic-risk-factors-for-depression>What are the genetic risk factors for depression?</h2>
<p>For people with genetic risk factors for depression, frequency of confiding in others and sleep duration were the most protective. How much time they spent on the computer and how much salt they consumed showed the highest increase in risk for depression.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-the-contributing-factors-to-adolescent-depression>What are the contributing factors to adolescent depression?</h2>
<p>of puberty, allowing different biological factors such as genetics, stress of puberty, and cognitive. changes to increase vulnerability to depression. Adolescents who had substance abuse problems. and/or held stronger neuroticism personality trait were more susceptibility to depression.</p>
<h2 id=how-many-people-in-the-us-suffer-from-depression>How many people in the US suffer from depression?</h2>
<p>In 2015, the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) estimated that 16.1 million American adults suffered from a major depressive episode. Although depression can affect anyone, certain factors may increase your likelihood of developing the disorder.</p>
