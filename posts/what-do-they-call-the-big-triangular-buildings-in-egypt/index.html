<p>The pyramids of Giza were royal tombs built for three different pharaohs. The northernmost and oldest pyramid of the group was built for Khufu (Greek: Cheops), the second king of the 4th dynasty. Called the Great Pyramid, it is the largest of the three.</p>
<h2 id=what-were-buildings-called-in-ancient-egypt>What were buildings called in ancient Egypt?</h2>
<p>The best known example of ancient Egyptian architecture are the Egyptian pyramids while excavated temples, palaces, tombs and fortresses have also been studied. Most buildings were built of locally available mud brick and limestone by levied workers.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-name-of-the-place-where-the-pyramids-were-built>What is the name of the place where the pyramids were built?</h2>
<p>The Giza Pyramids, built to endure an eternity, have done just that. The monumental tombs are relics of Egypt’s Old Kingdom era and were constructed some 4,500 years ago.</p>

<p>Great Pyramid<br>
The first, and largest, pyramid at Giza was built by the pharaoh Khufu (reign started around 2551 B.C.). His pyramid, which today stands 455 feet (138 meters) tall, is known as the “Great Pyramid” and was considered to be a wonder of the world by ancient writers.

<h2 id=how-tall-is-the-tallest-building-in-egypt>How tall is the tallest building in Egypt?</h2>
<p>Cairo’s skyline is one of the most densely packed in Africa and continues to grow. The tallest building in Egypt is the Iconic Tower at height of 385.8 m (1,266 ft) in the New Administrative Capital.</p>
<h2 id=when-was-the-last-pyramid-built-in-egypt>When was the last pyramid built in Egypt?</h2>
<p>In fact, archaeologists have never found evidence for the Biblical tales that the Israeli people were imprisoned in Egypt. And even if the Jewish people were imprisoned in Egypt, it’s extremely unlikely that they would have built the pyramids. The last pyramid, the so-called Pyramid of Ahmose, was built roughly 3,500 years ago.</p>
<h2 id=where-did-the-egyptians-get-the-materials-to-build-the-pyramids>Where did the Egyptians get the materials to build the pyramids?</h2>
<p>The site is called Heit el-Ghurab, and it was also likely part of a larger port city along the Nile River where food and supplies for the pyramid workers, as well as pyramid construction materials, were imported from across the region.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-the-ancient-egyptians-calculate-the-area-of-an-arch>How did the ancient Egyptians calculate the area of an arch?</h2>
<p>They could plot an arch by using offsets that were measured at regular intervals from a base line, and they could also find out areas. To find the area of a circle, the Egyptians used an area of a square on an 8/9 of the diameter, or (7/8) squared. They could also figure out the area of a triangle.</p>
