<h2 id=what-happens-when-the-polar-ice-caps-are-gone>What happens when the polar ice caps are gone?</h2>
<p>The disappearing ice in the Arctic affects more than just the surrounding area. As the Arctic’s ice disappears, the rest of the world experiences global warming. “If all the ice covering Antarctica , Greenland, and in mountain glaciers around the world were to melt, sea level would rise about 70 meters (230 feet).</p>
<h2 id=why-are-polar-ice-caps-important>Why are polar ice caps important?</h2>
<p>Why is Arctic sea ice important? Arctic sea ice keeps the polar regions cool and helps moderate global climate. Sea ice has a bright surface; 80 percent of the sunlight that strikes it is reflected back into space. The oceans heat up, and Arctic temperatures rise further.</p>
<h2 id=what-are-some-effects-of-the-disappearance-of-arctic-sea-ice>What are some effects of the disappearance of Arctic sea ice?</h2>
<p>Scientists believe the ice sheets moderate weather by reﬂecting heat away from the Earth, and their disappearance will contribute to more extreme weather in the coming decades. Melting Arctic sea ice will also contribute to sea level rise, both as it melts into the oceans and as the warming water expands.</p>
<h2 id=how-does-the-loss-of-polar-ice-caps-affect-albedo>How does the loss of polar ice caps affect albedo?</h2>
<p>The capacity of the Arctic to reflect heat is determined by something known as the albedo effect. As the albedo effect in the Arctic is reduced, there is a positive feedback effect because, as the region warms, more and more ice and snow cover is lost. As a result, more dark areas are left exposed to sunlight.</p>
<h2 id=does-the-reduction-in-polar-sea-ice-area-constitute-evidence-that-global-warming-is-real>Does the reduction in polar sea ice area constitute evidence that global warming is real?</h2>
<p>The area covered by Arctic sea ice is an important indicator of global climate change because as global temperatures rise, the rate at which warmer air and warmer water temperatures reduce the amount of existing sea ice can be measured.</p>
<h2 id=how-has-loss-of-ice-lead-to-an-increase-in-global-warming-quizlet>How has loss of ice lead to an increase in global warming quizlet?</h2>
<p>The mu lower albedo of water compared to ice means that more solar energy is absorbed by the ocean. This leads to warmer water, which further melts the ice, leading to ever more warming.</p>
<h2 id=what-happens-if-the-south-polar-ice-cap-melts>What happens if the south polar ice cap melts?</h2>
<p>South Polar Ice Cap is another story. This Ice cap is located on land and is not afloat. If it were to melt ot would result in rising sea levels any ice from the south Polar Ice Cap that flows into the ocean adds water to and or displaces ocean water and if done in a great enough manner will have an effect on sea level.</p>
<h2 id=how-does-the-loss-of-arctic-sea-ice-affect-the-world>How does the loss of Arctic sea ice affect the world?</h2>
<p>If emissions continue to rise unchecked, the Arctic could be ice-free in the summer by 2040. But what happens in the Arctic does not stay in the Arctic. Sea ice loss has far-reaching effects around the world. 1. Temperatures The Arctic and Antarctic are the world’s refrigerator.</p>
<h2 id=what-happens-if-the-perennial-sea-ice-disappears>What happens if the perennial sea ice disappears?</h2>
<p>“If the perennial ice cover, which consists mainly of thick multi-year ice floes, disappears, the entire Arctic Ocean climate and ecology would become very different,” said Josefino Comiso, a researcher at NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center, Greenbelt, Md., who authored the study.</p>
<h2 id=how-are-polar-bears-affected-by-sea-ice>How are polar bears affected by sea ice?</h2>
<p>Sea ice provides a platform from which polar bears can hunt, and it links communities of land animals such as foxes and wolves. “The sea ice cap has been retreating for decades, and as it does the animals who live on its edge have had to move north,” said Andrew Shepherd, professor of Earth observation at Leeds University.</p>
