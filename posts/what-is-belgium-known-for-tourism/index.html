<h2 id=what-is-belgium-known-for-tourism>What is Belgium known for tourism?</h2>

<h2 id=why-do-tourists-visit-belgium>Why do tourists visit Belgium?</h2>
<p>The first and most obvious reason to visit Belgium is for the incredible architecture, scenic small towns on lakes, and even a large city such as Antwerp that has so much to offer despite its larger size. The town of Bruges is undeniably the biggest tourist drawcard in Belgium.</p>

<h2 id=what-are-the-most-popular-places-to-visit-in-belgium>What are the most popular places to visit in Belgium?</h2>
<p>Among the most recognizable sights in Belgium are the beautiful belfry and Halle, which dominate the main square of Bruges. Dating from the medieval era, this impressive building once functioned as the main town market hall and has been wonderfully preserved, allowing visitors a real taste of the architectural might of the Middle Ages.</p>
<h2 id=how-long-does-it-take-to-get-to-tourist-attractions-in-belgium>How long does it take to get to tourist attractions in Belgium?</h2>
<p>Because it’s so small, visitors can get to almost any of the tourist attractions in Belgium with three or four hours of train travel. Belgium is also the place that gave the world Belgian waffles, if more incentive is needed to travel there.</p>
<h2 id=where-does-belgium-rank-in-the-world-for-tourism>Where does Belgium rank in the world for tourism?</h2>
<p>Belgium was ranked 21st on the World Economic Forum’s 2017 Travel and Tourism Competitiveness report. The country was placed 4th for “health and hygiene” and 6th for “ground and port infrastructure”, but only 105th in the world for “price competitiveness” and 122nd for “natural resources”.</p>
<h2 id=who-are-the-national-tourist-agencies-in-belgium>Who are the National Tourist agencies in Belgium?</h2>
<p>Like many national institutions in Belgium, the national tourist agencies are split along regional lines with two tourist agencies. They are the Belgian Tourist Office Brussels & Wallonia for the regions of Wallonia and Brussels Capital-Region, and Toerisme Vlaanderen covering Flanders, although it covers Brussels as well.</p>
