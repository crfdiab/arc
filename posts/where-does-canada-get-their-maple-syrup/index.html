<h2 id=where-does-canada-get-their-maple-syrup>Where does Canada get their maple syrup?</h2>
<p>Quebec<br>
Canada produces 71% of the world’s pure maple syrup, 91% of which is produced in Quebec. Canada’s maple syrup producing regions are located in the provinces of Quebec (primary producer), Ontario, New Brunswick, Prince Edward Island and Nova Scotia.</p>

<p>province of Quebec<br>
The vast majority of Canada’s maple syrup is produced in the eastern province of Quebec. As the leading maple syrup producer in Canada, Quebec has by far the largest number of maple farms and, as a result, the most maple taps.</p>

<p>liquid gold<br>
Maple syrup, also known in Canada as liquid gold, is a truly special product. Created from the sweet sap of the maple tree, the leaf even emblazons the Canadian flag – but there’s much more to it than a breakfast ingredient to pour on your pancakes.</p>

<p>Where does maple syrup come from? Canada produces 71% of the world’s pure maple syrup, 91% of which is produced in Quebec. Canada’s maple syrup producing regions are located in the provinces of Quebec (primary producer), Ontario, New Brunswick, Prince Edward Island and Nova Scotia.</p>
<h2 id=where-are-the-maple-trees-located-in-canada>Where are the maple trees located in Canada?</h2>
<p>Ontario, Quebec, New Brunswick, and Nova Scotia together form the so-called Maple Belt. This area of Canada is blessed with an enormous variety of trees which produce the highest quality syrup. The first people who produced maple syrup and maple sugar were the indigenous people in northeastern North America.</p>
<h2 id=how-does-maple-syrup-get-out-of-the-tree>How does maple syrup get out of the tree?</h2>
<p>When the weather begins to get warmer, that starch heats up and mixes with water to turn into sugar. That sugary sap, or xylem, then rises up throughout the tree, picking up its iconic flavor from the wood. When the xylem is removed from the tree and boiled down, it becomes pure maple syrup.</p>
<h2 id=how-many-pounds-of-maple-syrup-does-canada-export>How many pounds of maple syrup does Canada export?</h2>
<p>Today, Canadian maple syrup is exported to approximately 50 countries, including the U.S., which is the primary importer. In 2017, Canada produced 12.5 million pounds of maple syrup exported 62.9 to the U.S. using reserve supply from previous years to support the growing exportation demand.</p>
