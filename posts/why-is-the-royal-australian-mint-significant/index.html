<p>The mint serves primarily to manufacture Australia’s legal tender precious metal coins. Notes are produced by Note Printing Australia in Melbourne. The mint also produces medals for military and civilian honours, most notably the Order of Australia.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-difference-between-perth-mint-and-royal-australian-mint>What is the difference between Perth Mint and Royal Australian Mint?</h2>
<p>The Royal Australian Mint is the Federal Mint and produces coins for circulation as well as NCLT. The Perth Mint (aka Gold Corporation) is a State Mint (owned by the WA government) that at one time produced coins for circulation, but now is operated as a business with a Federal agreement to produce NCLT.</p>
<h2 id=which-two-coins-are-no-longer-used-in-australia>Which two coins are no longer used in Australia?</h2>
<p>The Holey Dollar and Dump are the only Australian coins which have had their ‘legal tender’ status removed, or been ‘demonetised’. Some coins which are no longer in circulation, such as Australia’s pre-decimal coins and the 1 and 2 cent coin are still ‘legal tender.</p>
<h2 id=is-australia-getting-rid-of-the-5-cent-coin>Is Australia getting rid of the 5 cent coin?</h2>

<h2 id=is-the-perth-mint-legal-tender>Is the Perth mint legal tender?</h2>

<h2 id=do-perth-mint-coins-increase-in-value>Do Perth Mint coins increase in value?</h2>
<p>However in saying this some bullion coins become very popular and increase in value considerably over the years. The Lunar Ox, Mouse and Rabbit coins from the Perth Mint are just some examples. Certain sizes of these coins also had a very low mintage further increasing prices.</p>
<h2 id=how-much-are-old-australian-coins-worth>How much are old Australian coins worth?</h2>

<h2 id=why-was-the-royal-australian-mint-renovated-in-1984>Why was the Royal Australian Mint renovated in 1984?</h2>

<p>With the introduction of the PGPA Act 2013, the Mint is now classed as a listed entity within Treasury. The Mint was established in Canberra in 1965, one year prior to Australia’s changeover to decimal currency and since 1983 has been the sole supplier of Australia’s circulating coin requirements.</p>
