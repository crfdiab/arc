<h2 id=why-are-the-great-lakes-important>Why are the Great Lakes important?</h2>
<p>Why is the Great Lakes Ecosystem important? The Great Lakes Basin Ecosystem is the largest body of freshwater in the world. It holds 18 percent of the world’s supply of fresh water; covers 95,000 square miles with 9,000 miles of shoreline; includes 5,000 tributaries; and has a drainage area of 288,000 square miles.</p>
<h2 id=why-are-the-5-great-lakes-important>Why are the 5 Great Lakes important?</h2>
<p>And most of the globe’s freshwater supply is either frozen in glaciers or buried underground. One reason why the Great Lakes are so important is they harbor 20 percent of all the liquid water on Earth’s surface. Put together, the five Great Lakes have 6 quadrillion gallons of it.</p>
<h2 id=how-have-the-great-lakes-contributed-to-the-development-of-both-the-united-states-and-canada>How have the Great Lakes contributed to the development of both the United States and Canada?</h2>
<p>How have the Great Lakes contributed to the development of both the United States and Canada? By supplying 20% of the worlds fresh water supply, it also contributed by being able to transport materials and use them for trade.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-so-special-about-the-great-lakes>What is so special about the Great Lakes?</h2>
<p>The Great Lakes and their connecting rivers and channels make up the largest fresh surface water system in the world. In fact, they’re so big that astronauts can see them from the moon! That’s about 22 percent of the world’s fresh surface water supply and about 90 percent of the United States’ supply.</p>
<h2 id=how-do-the-great-lakes-impact-the-economy-of-canada-and-the-united-states>How do the Great Lakes impact the economy of Canada and the United States?</h2>
<p>It alone accounts for more than 50% of all U.S./Canadian bilateral border trade and sees over 200 million tons of cargo shipped annually. If it were its own country, it would have a GDP of US$6 trillion – making it the third biggest economy in the world.</p>
<h2 id=why-are-the-great-lakes-important-to-the-united-states>Why are the Great Lakes important to the United States?</h2>
<p>The Great Lakes are important because they contain 20 percent of the world’s fresh water and exhibit tremendous biodiversity. They are also a vital water source and play an important role in transportation and the U.S. and Canadian economies.</p>
<h2 id=how-many-people-depend-on-the-great-lakes>How many people depend on the Great Lakes?</h2>
<p>They are the world’s largest surface freshwater ecosystem and contain 20 percent of all surface freshwater on the planet. More than 35 million people in eight states and Canada depend on the Lakes for their drinking water.</p>
<h2 id=how-is-water-managed-in-the-great-lakes>How is water managed in the Great Lakes?</h2>
<p>See how states across the Basin are managing water under the Great Lakes Compact (PDF). The Compact requires anyone outside the basin who wants to use Great Lakes water to meet strict criteria. The Compact specifies that the states and the Compact Council must review any new diversions of Great Lakes water.</p>
<h2 id=why-is-the-national-wildlife-federation-important-to-the-great-lakes>Why is the National Wildlife Federation important to the Great Lakes?</h2>
<p>The National Wildlife Federation led efforts to negotiate and pass the Great Lakes Compact. Removing water from the Great Lakes basin can put fish and wildlife at risk by damaging habitat and degrading water quality. Predicted lower Great Lakes water levels due to climate change and increased water use are looming threats to the Great Lakes.</p>
