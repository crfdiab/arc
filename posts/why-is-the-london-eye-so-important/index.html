<h2 id=why-is-the-london-eye-so-important>Why is the London Eye so important?</h2>
<p>A London Icon: The London Eye has quickly reached an iconic status and is regularly used in PR across the world to symbolize modern London. Gracefully hanging over the river Thames, the London Eye is a feat of design and engineering, the first of its kind and the only cantilevered observation wheel in the world.</p>
<h2 id=what-was-the-london-eye-originally-called>What was the London Eye originally called?</h2>
<p>British Airways London Eye<br>
Yes, the London Eye is also known as the Millennium Wheel. But it’s had many official names, courtesy of its various owners and sponsors. First, it was called the British Airways London Eye; then the Merlin Entertainments London Eye; then the EDF Energy London Eye.</p>
<h2 id=when-was-the-eye-built-in-london>When was the eye built in London?</h2>
<p>1998<br>

<h2 id=who-built-the-london-eye-facts>Who built the London Eye facts?</h2>
<p>Marks Barfield Architects<br>
At 135m, The London Eye is the world’s largest cantilevered observation wheel. It was conceived and designed by Marks Barfield Architects and was launched in 2000.</p>
<h2 id=how-much-money-is-the-london-eye>How much money is the London Eye?</h2>
<p>The standard adult book online in advance ticket currently costs £27.00 and a child ticket costs £22.00. If you were to turn up on the day and queue then the adult price is £30.00 and a child is £24.00.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-special-about-the-london-eye>What is special about the London Eye?</h2>
<p>It is Europe’s tallest cantilevered observation wheel, and is the most popular paid tourist attraction in the United Kingdom with over 3 million visitors annually. It has made many appearances in popular culture. The structure is 135 metres (443 ft) tall and the wheel has a diameter of 120 metres (394 ft).</p>
<h2 id=how-long-is-a-ride-on-the-london-eye>How long is a ride on the London Eye?</h2>
<p>around 30 minutes<br>
One rotation on the London Eye will take around 30 minutes.</p>
<h2 id=who-owns-london-eye>Who owns London Eye?</h2>
<p>Merlin Entertainments<br>
lastminute.com London Eye/Owners</p>
<p>The London Eye’s original owners were British Airways, Marks Barfield, and the Tussauds Group. Tussauds became the sole owner in 2006. The following year Tussauds was sold to the Blackstone Group, a private equity firm that folded the London Eye into its Merlin Entertainments Group.</p>
<h2 id=is-the-london-eye-scary>Is the London Eye scary?</h2>
<p>It’s not at all scary, rather it’s very nice to have a ride in it to have a look at beautiful Thames river and the adjoining London city. It easily take about 15~20 minutes to complete the ride. It’s not like a regular giant wheel which rotates at a much faster speed.</p>
<h2 id=when-did-they-start-building-the-london-eye>When did they start building the London Eye?</h2>
<p>The London Eye was first built in 1999 in celebration of the new millennium. It was formally opened on 31st December 1999 by then Prime Minister, Tony Blair. The idea was chosen from a host of entries into a competition held back in 1993 to suggest a new landmark to signify the turning of the century. What Is The London Eye’s ‘Proper’ Name?</p>
<h2 id=why-was-the-london-eye-built-over-water>Why was the London Eye built over water?</h2>
<p>With an ambitious target set to have the wheel finished before New Year’s Eve 1999, a team of 1,700 dedicated professionals worked tirelessly to execute and deliver a design unique to its own; including transportation of the Eye up the River Thames to its chosen destination, thus now the only wheel in the world to have ever been built over water.</p>
<h2 id=why-do-people-go-to-the-london-eye>Why do people go to the London Eye?</h2>
<p>The third reason why you should visit the London Eye is other attractions around the London Eye are next to each other. If you want to buy the London Eye tickets, make sure to buy London Dungeon and Sealife London Aquarium tickets as part of the promotional deal and they are located next to each other.</p>
<h2 id=how-did-the-london-eye-wheel-get-built>How did the London Eye wheel get built?</h2>
<p>Although no winner was declared, Marks and Barfield undertook the development of the project themselves and found the site where the wheel now stands. Much of the funding was provided by British Airways. Construction began in 1998, and the wheel was put together over the river, in a horizontal position, before being pulled upright.</p>
