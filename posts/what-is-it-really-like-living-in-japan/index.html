<h2 id=what-is-it-really-like-living-in-japan>What is it really like living in Japan?</h2>
<p>Japanese society is vibrant, safe, orderly, and welcoming to strangers. Once you take care of a few details, you’ll be able to settle in without too much hassle and begin living an exciting new chapter in your life.</p>
<h2 id=how-does-japan-make-a-living>How does Japan make a living?</h2>
<p>The largest industries are agriculture and fishing, manufacturing, and tourism among others. Japan’s GDP per sector is as follows: services 71.4%, industry 27.5%, and agriculture 1.2%. 0.2% of the population of Japan lives under the poverty line of under $1.90 a day. The unemployment rate is 2.90%.</p>

<p>A single person living in Tokyo can expect to spend around 120,000 JPY (1,100 USD) per month, not including rent. If you add in the average rental price for a one-bedroom apartment, this expense goes up to nearly 245,000 JPY (2,200 USD). A family living in Tokyo will see that number tripled.</p>
<h2 id=why-do-people-want-to-live-in-japan>Why do people want to live in Japan?</h2>
<p>Many people consider living in Japan and I, living here myself, can see many reasons why. There are convenience stores everywhere, low crime, and an endless amount of travel destinations packed into one medium-sized island. However, when finally moving to Japan, there are culture shocks that you experience more as you live in the country.</p>
<h2 id=what-kind-of-work-do-people-do-in-japan>What kind of work do people do in Japan?</h2>
<p>The number of people in the Japanese labor force increased steadily from 36 million workers 1950 to 64 million in 1995, and then began to decline slightly. Over that time the nature of work has changed considerably. In 1950, nearly half (48.5%) of the labor force was engaged in farming, forestry, or fishing, which is called the primary sector.</p>
<h2 id=whats-the-life-like-in-japan-as-a-kid>What’s the life like in Japan as a kid?</h2>
<p>Life in Japan can be challenging, but also absolutely amazing and wonderful. Having spent two years in the country of the rising sun as a kid I still remember quite a lot of things that kept me thrilled and amazed. Here are ten things about the Japanese lifestyle that you should know before moving in or traveling to this wonderful country! 1.</p>
<h2 id=what-do-people-in-japan-do-for-fun>What do people in Japan do for fun?</h2>
<p>Texan blogger and comic book artist. High flying divas of the ring battle it out in the knock out world of Japanese woman’s wrestling. You probably won’t find a weird vending machine or professional geisha, roaming the streets of Tokyo. Going to the restroom is a serious business in Japan.</p>
