<h2 id=why-do-inner-planets-revolve-faster-around-the-sun>Why do inner planets revolve faster around the Sun?</h2>
<p>Solar System. The Sun’s gravity holds the inner planets tightly as they revolve around the Sun. The orbits of Mercury, Venus, Earth, and Mars revolve faster than the outer planets because they have less distance to travel. They revolve around the Sun all within a relatively flat plane.</p>
<h2 id=which-planet-revolves-around-the-sun-the-fastest-and-why>Which planet revolves around the Sun the fastest and why?</h2>
<p>Answer: Mercury is the winner at an orbital speed of about 47.87 km/s (107,082 miles per hour), which is a period of about 87.97 Earth days.</p>
<h2 id=why-do-outer-planets-travel-slower-than-inner-planets>Why do outer planets travel slower than inner planets?</h2>
<p>Gravity is stronger nearer the sun. Planets that are closer to the sun then need to have higher speeds in order to balance the higher pull of gravity. For the outer planets they have further to go and a slower speed so their orbital periods are much longer than that of the earth.</p>
<h2 id=do-planets-revolve-around-the-sun-at-the-same-speed>Do planets revolve around the Sun at the same speed?</h2>
<p>No, the planets do not revolve around the sun at the same speeds. The farther they are from the sun, the longer a planet takes to make each revolution around the sun and the slower it travels through space.</p>
<h2 id=who-is-the-slowest-planet-to-revolve-around-the-sun>Who is the slowest planet to revolve around the Sun?</h2>
<p>Venus<br>
In fact, Venus takes 243 Earth days to rotate once on its axis – the slowest rotation of any planet – and its rotation is retrograde to its orbital path. Combined with its orbital period, this means that a single solar day on Venus (the time between one sunup to the next) is 117 Earth days.</p>
<h2 id=why-do-the-planets-revolve-around-the-sun>Why do the planets revolve around the Sun?</h2>
<p>These revolve around the sun just because of the gravitational force which is exerted on the planets by the sun. If the sun does not exerts any force on the planets then the planets do not revolve around the sun and they lost in the universe by their random motion.</p>
<h2 id=why-does-each-planet-have-a-different-orbital-speed>Why does each planet have a different orbital speed?</h2>
<p>This is because of the gravitational force being exerted on the planets by the sun. Additionally, according to Kepler’s laws of planetary motion, the flight path of every planet is in the shape of an ellipse. Below is a list of the planet’s orbital speeds in order from fastest to slowest.</p>
<h2 id=why-are-inner-planets-closer-to-their-star-than-outer-planets>Why are inner planets closer to their star than outer planets?</h2>
<p>Inner planets are nearer to their star than the outer planets. So they experience a greater gravitational force . And to overcome this inward force they need to apply an outward force known as centrifugal force.</p>
<h2 id=are-there-any-planets-that-rotate-in-the-same-direction>Are there any planets that rotate in the same direction?</h2>
<p>The planets all revolve around the sun in the same direction and in virtually the same plane. In addition, they all rotate in the same general direction, with the exceptions of Venus and Uranus.</p>
