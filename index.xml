Deforestation leads to reduced rainfall because it reduces the natural recycling of moisture from the soils. This recycling takes place through vegetation and returns to the form of rainfall.
How does deforestation affect rainfall? Trees evaporate water to form clouds. As a result deforestation leads to the less water absorbed from the soil affecting the water cycle and formation of clouds becomes difficult leading to reduced rainfall.</description></item><item><title>Why is heat flow high at mid-ocean ridge?</title><link>https://bigkb.co.uk/posts/why-is-heat-flow-high-at-mid-ocean-ridge/</link><pubDate>Sun, 16 Dec 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://bigkb.co.uk/posts/why-is-heat-flow-high-at-mid-ocean-ridge/</guid><description>Why is heat flow high at mid-ocean ridge? This asthenospheric mantle upwells into the void formed by diverging plates. As the source of this material is deeper within the Earth it is much warmer, thus produces a signature of high heat flow.
What causes the thermal-energy to be higher along the ridge? Why are thermal energy measurements greater closer to the ridge? The magma/lava along the ridge causes the thermal energy to be higher here than farther away from the ridge.</description></item><item><title>Why is it called Le Mans?</title><link>https://bigkb.co.uk/posts/why-is-it-called-le-mans/</link><pubDate>Sun, 16 Dec 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://bigkb.co.uk/posts/why-is-it-called-le-mans/</guid><description>Why is it called Le Mans?
