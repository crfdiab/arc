The returning boomerang is generally considered to have developed from the nonreturning types, which swerve in flight. The nonreturning boomerang is longer, straighter, and heavier than the returning variety. With it animals were maimed and killed, while in warfare it caused serious injuries and death.
How do boomerangs kill? The first boomerangs were used for hunting and killing. The hunting type could be hurled at distances of 150 to 200 yards.</description></item><item><title>Why are Japanese cars more reliable than American?</title><link>https://bigkb.co.uk/posts/why-are-japanese-cars-more-reliable-than-american/</link><pubDate>Sat, 15 Dec 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://bigkb.co.uk/posts/why-are-japanese-cars-more-reliable-than-american/</guid><description>Why are Japanese cars more reliable than American? The main reasons that Japanese cars consistently rate higher in terms of quality than US cars are: Japanese cars are built by two world-class manufacturers: Honda and Toyota.

Historically, cities have been located on coastlines because there are many transport, food and ecological benefits. Products – and therefore money – traditionally flows into countries through their ports. This has set a precedence for populations to naturally migrate towards coastal areas.
