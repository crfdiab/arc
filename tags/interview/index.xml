My answer was hell yeah!
I think it&amp;rsquo;s great that management involves senior developers in the selection process. On the one hand, it&amp;rsquo;s good for the team if they know that someone who is hands-on with the code saw the new colleague, talked to him/her and asked - hopefully - relevant questions. On the other hand, it&amp;rsquo;s also reassuring for the candidates that they can talk to someone who is doing the same job as he would.</description></item></channel></rss>
