Welcome to the first edition of {Tech &amp;amp; Dev}.
At the beginning of this year, I made a goal for myself to be more consistent with creating things — whether it be through my writing or making mini-apps on the side to learn new things and keep up with the tech.

Understanding how code works is more important than coding an app, Understanding how your own thoughts work is even more important.</description></item></channel></rss>
